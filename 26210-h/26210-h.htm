<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A while</span> ago I came across a newspaper
clipping&mdash;a recipe written by a Baltimore
lady&mdash;that had long lain dormant
in my desk. It ran as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;A great many husbands are spoiled by
mismanagement. Some women go about
it as if their husbands were bladders, and
blow them up; others keep them constantly
in hot water; others let them freeze, by
their carelessness and indifference. Some
keep them in a stew, by irritating ways and
words; others roast them; some keep them
in pickle all their lives. Now it is not to
be supposed that any husband will be good,
managed in this way&mdash;turnips wouldn&#8217;t;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>onions wouldn&#8217;t; cabbage-heads wouldn&#8217;t,
and husbands won&#8217;t; but they are really
delicious when properly treated.</p>

<p>&#8220;In selecting your husband you should
not be guided by the silvery appearance,
as in buying mackerel, or by the golden
tint, as if you wanted salmon. Be sure to
select him yourself, as taste differs. And
by the way, don&#8217;t go to market for him,
as the best are always brought to your
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is far better to have none, unless
you patiently learn to cook him. A preserving
kettle of the finest porcelain is the
best, but if you have nothing but an
earthenware pipkin, it will do, with care.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that the linen, in which you wrap
him, is nicely washed and mended, with
the required amount of buttons and strings,
nicely sewed on. Tie him in the kettle
with a strong cord called Comfort, as the
one called Duty is apt to be weak. They
sometimes fly out of the kettle, and become
burned and crusty on the edges, since, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>crabs and oysters, you have to cook them
alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a clear, strong, steady fire out of
Love, Neatness, and Cheerfulness. Set
him as near this as seems to agree with him.
If he sputters and fizzles, don&#8217;t be anxious;
some husbands do this till they are quite
done. Add a little sugar, in the form of
what confectioners call Kisses, but no vinegar
or pepper on any account. A little
spice improves them, but it must be used
with judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stick any sharp instrument into
him, to see if he is becoming tender. Stir
him gently; watching the while lest he
should lie too close to the kettle, and so become
inert and useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot fail to know when he is
done. If thus treated, you will find him
very digestible, agreeing nicely with you
and the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are better cooked,&#8221; I said to
myself, &#8220;that is why we hear of such
numbers of cases of marital indigestion&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>husbands are served raw&mdash;fresh&mdash;unprepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are really delicious when properly
treated,&#8221;&mdash;I wonder if that is so.</p>

<p>But I must pause here to tell you a bit
about myself. I am not an old maid, but,
at the time this occurs, I am unmarried,
and I am thirty-four years old&mdash;not
quite beyond the pale of hope. Men and
women never do pass beyond that&mdash;not
those of sanguine temperament at any rate.
I am neither rich nor poor, but repose in a
comfortable stratum betwixt and between.
I keep house, or rather it keeps me, and a
respectable woman who, with her husband,
manages my domestic affairs, lends
the odor of sanctity and propriety to my
single existence. I am of medium height,
between blond and brunette, and am said to
have a modicum of both brains and good
looks.</p>

<p>The recipe I read set me a-thinking.
I was in my library, before a big log fire.
The room was comfortable; glowing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>rich, warm firelight at that moment, but
it was lonesome, and I was lonely.</p>

<p>Supposing, I said to myself, I really had
a husband; how should I cook him?</p>

<p>The words of an old lady came into my
mind. She had listened to this particular
recipe, and after a moment&#8217;s silence had
leaned over, and whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;First catch your fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>But supposing he were now caught, and
seated in that rocker across from me, before
this blazing fire.</p>

<p>I walked to the window&mdash;to one side of
me lives a little thrush, at least she is trim
and comely, and always dresses in brown.
Just now she is without her door, stooping
over her baby, who is sitting like a tiny
queen in her chariot, just returned from
an airing.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t the question of husband alone&mdash;he
might be managed&mdash;roasted, stewed, or
parboiled, but it&#8217;s the whole family&mdash;a
household. Take the children, for instance;
if they could be set up on shelves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>glass cases, as fast as they came, all might
be well, but they <i>will</i> run around, and
Heaven only knows what they will run
into. Why, had I children, I should plug
both ears with cotton, for fear I should
hear the door-bell. I know it would ring
constantly, and such messages as these
would be hurled in:</p>

<p>&#8220;Several of them have been arrested for
blowing up the neighbors with dynamite
firecrackers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half a dozen of them have tumbled from
off the roof of the house. They escaped
injury, but have thrown a nervous lady,
over the way, into spasms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One or two of them have just been
dragged from beneath the electric cars.
They seem to be as well as ever, but three
of the passengers died of fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just think of that! What should I do?</p>

<p>Keep an extra maid to answer the bell,
I suppose, and two or three thousand dollars
by me continually, to pay damages.</p>

<p>What a time poor Job had of it answering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>his door bell, and how very unpleasant
it must have been to receive so many pieces
of news of that sort, in one morning!</p>

<p>Clearly I am better off in my childless
condition, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Thrush is just kissing her
soft, round-faced cherub. I wish she
would do that out of sight.</p>

<p>Now as to husbands again, if I had one,
what should I do with him?</p>

<p>I might say, Sit down.</p>

<p>Supposing he wouldn&#8217;t. What then?</p>

<p>Cudgels are out of date. Were he an
alderman, I might take a Woman&#8217;s Club
to him, but a husband has been known to
laugh this instrument to scorn.</p>

<p>But supposing he sat down. What
then? He might be a gentleman of irascible,
nasty temper, and in walking about
my room, I might step on his feet. These
irritable folk have such large feet, at least
they are always in the way, and always
being stepped on no matter how careful
one tries to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>What then?</p>

<p>I decline to contemplate the scene.</p>

<p>Plainly I am better off single.</p>

<p>I walk to my front window, and stretch
my arms above my head. There is a
light fall of snow upon the ground. This
late snow is trying: in its season, it is
beautiful; but out of season, it breeds a
cheerlessness that emphasises one&#8217;s loneliness.
I look out through the leafless trees
toward the lake, but it is hidden by the
whirling, eddying snowflakes. I see Mr.
Thrush hurrying home to his little nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I say to myself, repeating my
last thought with a certain obstinacy,
&#8220;yes, I am better off without a husband,
and yet I wish I had one&mdash;one would answer,
on a pinch&mdash;one at a time, at least.
A husband is like a world in that respect;
one at a time, is the proper proportion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s far better to have none, unless you
learn to cook him.&#8221; These words recurred
to me, just as I was on the point of
taking a life partner, in a figurative sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The woman that deliberates is lost; consequently,
as it won&#8217;t do to think the matter
over, I plunge in.</p>

<p>My spouse is now pacing up and down
the room in a rampant manner, complaining
of his dinner, the world in general,
and <i>me</i> in particular.</p>

<p>What am I to do?</p>

<p>Charles Reade has written a recipe that
applies very well just here. It is briefly
expressed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put yourself in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not have done this a few years
ago, but now I can. Never, until I undertook
the management of my business
affairs&mdash;never until I had some knowledge
of business cares and anxieties, the weight
of notes falling due; the charge of business
honor to keep; the excited hope of
fortunate prospects; and the depression
following hard upon failure and disappointment&mdash;never
until I learned all this,
did I realize what home should mean to a
man, and how far wide of the mark many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>women shoot, when they aim to establish
a restful retreat for their husbands.</p>

<p>I have returned to my domicile, after a
fatiguing day up town, with a feeling of
exhaustion that lies far deeper than the
mere physical structure&mdash;a spent feeling
as if I have given my all, and must be replenished
before I can make another
move. I once had a housekeeper whose
very face I dreaded at such times. She
always took advantage of my silence and
my limp condition, to relate the day&#8217;s disasters.
She had no knowledge of what a
good dinner meant, and no tact in falling
in with my tastes or needs. On the contrary;
if there was a dish I disliked, it was
sure to appear on those most weary evenings.
In brief, from the very moment I
reached home, she did nothing but brush
my fur up, instead of down, and I did
nothing but spit at her.</p>

<p>Now, many women are like this housekeeper.
I wonder their husbands don&#8217;t
slay them. If you would look out in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>back yard, I fear you would see the bones
of several of these tactless, exasperating
housekeepers, bleaching in the wind and
rain.</p>

<p>I marvel that other back yards are not
filled with the bones of stupid, tactless,
irritating wives. The fact that no such
horror has as yet been unearthed, bears
eloquent testimony to the noble self-control
and patience of many of the sterner sex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that sounds well,&#8221; said my neighbor,
over the way, &#8220;but then you forget
we women have our trials too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it going to diminish those trials to
make a raging lion out of your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he ought to understand that
we are tired, and that our work is hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; I said, &#8220;by all means; and
by the time he thoroughly understands,
you generally have occasion to be still
more tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;d do; follow the
advice of a sensible little friend of mine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>who has four children all of an age, and
has incompetent service to rely on, when
she has any at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that come rain, hail, or fiery
vapor, she takes a nap every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how she manages it; I
can&#8217;t, and I have one less child than she,
and a fairly good maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her children are trained, as children
should be; the three younger ones take
long naps after luncheon, and while they
are sleeping, she gives the oldest child
some picture book to look at, and simple
stories to read, and she herself goes to
sleep in the same room with him. The
little fellow keeps as still as a mouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is a cruel shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. It would be far kinder if she
let him have his liberty, and stayed up to
take care of him, and then became so tired
out that, by the time her husband came
home she would be unable to keep her
mouth (closed for it is only a well rested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>woman who can maintain a cheerful
silence), and avoid a family quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think it&#8217;s better not to quarrel,
but I can&#8217;t take a nap, and often I&#8217;m so
tired when Fred comes home, that, if he
happens to be tired too, it&#8217;s just like putting
fire to gunpowder.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew that, for I had heard the explosions
from across the street. You know
in our climate, in the summer, people
practically live in the street, with every
window and door open; your neighbor has
full possession of all remarks above E.
And most of Mr. and Mrs. Purblind&#8217;s
notes on the tired nights, are above E.</p>

<p>I have no patience with that woman,
anyhow. She hasn&#8217;t the first idea of comfort
and good cheer. Her rooms are always
in disorder, and there is no suggestion
of harmony in the furniture (on the
contrary every article seems, as the French
say, to be swearing at every other article);
all her lights are high&mdash;why, I&#8217;ve run in
there of an evening and found that man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>wandering around like an uneasy ghost,
trying to find some easy spot in which he
could sit down, and read his paper comfortably.
He didn&#8217;t know what was the
matter&mdash;the poor wretches don&#8217;t, but he
was like a cat on an unswept hearth.</p>

<p>In contrast to this woman&#8217;s stupidity,
I have the natural loveliness of the little
brown thrush, on my one side, and the
hoary-headed wisdom of Mrs. Owl, on my
other side.</p>

<p>Look at the latter a moment. Not
worth looking at, you say; angular, without
beauty of form or feature. Nothing
but the humorous curve to her lips, and
the twinkle in her eye, to attract one;
nothing, unless it were a general air of
neatness, intelligence, and good humor.</p>

<p>But I assure you that woman&#8217;s worth
living with if she is not worth looking at!</p>

<p>Now her spouse is one of those lowering
fellows, the kind that seems to be at outs
with mankind. Just the material to become
sulky in any but the most skillful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>hands, the sort to degenerate into a positive
brute, in such blundering hands as
Mrs. Purblind&#8217;s over the way.</p>

<p>I had a chance to watch this man one
evening last summer. Having no domestic
affairs of my own, as a matter of course I
feel myself entitled to share my neighbors&#8217;.
And this particular evening I was lonely.
It was a nasty night, the fog blown in from
the lake slapped one rudely in the face
every time one looked out, and the air was
as raw as a new wound&mdash;it went clear to
the bone.</p>

<p>Now on such a night as this I have
known Mrs. Purblind to serve her lord
cold veal and lettuce, simple because it was
July, and a suitable time for heat. And
I assure you that sufficient heat was generated
before this cold supper was consumed.
But to return to Mrs. Owl, on
that particular night. I saw her watching
at door and window, for her partner was
late. I peeped into the parlor, and it was
as cosy and inviting as a glowing fire, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>shaded lamp, and a comfortable sofa
wheeled near the table, could make it.</p>

<p>By and by, he came glowering along.
What will she say, I asked myself. Will
it be:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how late you are! What&#8217;s the
matter? What kept you? Well, come in,
you must be cold. Lie down on the sofa
while I get supper, but don&#8217;t put your feet
up till I get a paper for them to rest on.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this would have answered well
enough with a decent sort of a man, but
this homo required peculiar treatment.</p>

<p>It was what she didn&#8217;t say that was
most remarkable.</p>

<p>After a cheerful &#8220;How-de-do&#8221; she didn&#8217;t
speak a word for some time, but walked
into the house humming a lively air, and
busied herself with his supper. She didn&#8217;t
set this in the dining room, but right before
that open fire. Without any fuss or
commotion she broiled a piece of steak
over those glowing coals, while over her
big lamp she made a cup of coffee, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>her chafing dish prepared some creamed
potatoes. She had bread and butter ready,
and some little dessert, and so with a wave
of a fairy wand, as it seemed, there was
the cosiest, most tempting little supper you
ever saw on the table at his side.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had found the sofa,
the fire, and the lamp, and was reading
his paper. He threw the latter down
when supper was announced, and she
joined him at the table; poured his coffee,
ate a bit now and then for company,
and talked&mdash;why, how that woman did
talk! I couldn&#8217;t hear a word that she said,
but I knew by the expression of her face it
was humorous; and laugh, how she
laughed! and erelong he joined in&mdash;why,
once he leaned back, and actually ha-haed.</p>

<p>When supper was over, she left him to
his paper again, while she cleared everything
away. Later on she joined him,
and the next I knew they were playing
chess, and still later, talking and reading
aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>This is but a sample of her life with him&mdash;in
everything she consults his mood, his
comfort, his tastes. She never jars him&mdash;never
rubs him the wrong way, and meanwhile
she has all she wants, for she can do
anything with him, and he thinks the sun
rises and sets with her.</p>

<p>It is a good cook that makes an appetizing
dish out of poor material, and when a
woman makes a delicious husband out of
little or nothing she may rank as a <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> may say all I have been describing
belongs more properly to little Mrs.
Thrush, on my right. Bless you! that
woman doesn&#8217;t have to think and plan to
make things comfortable. Were she set
down in the desert of Sahara, she would
sweep it up, spread a rug; hang a few
draperies, and lo! it would be cosy and
home-like. She can&#8217;t help being and doing
just right, wherever she is put, and her
husband is just like her, as good as gold.
Why, that man would bore a woman of
ingenuity&mdash;a woman who had a genius for
contriving and managing. He doesn&#8217;t
need any cooking; he&#8217;s ready to serve just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>as he is, couldn&#8217;t be improved. There&#8217;s
absolutely nothing to be done. Mrs. Owl
would get a divorce from him inside of a
month, on the ground of insipidity. Her
fine capabilities for making much out of
nothing, would turn saffron for lack of
use. Mr. Owl is the mate for her. To
every man according to his taste; to every
woman according to her need.</p>

<p>I am lying in the hammock, under the
soft maple tree in my side yard, speculating
on all these matters. Summer is now
upon us, for we are in the midst of June.
Yesterday was one of Lowell&#8217;s rare days,
but this morning the thermometer took
offense, and rose in fury. I can see the
quivering air as it radiates from the dusty,
sun-beaten road, and a certain drowsy
hum in the atmosphere, palpable only to
the trained ear, tells of the great heat.
Some of my neighbors are sitting on their
galleries, reading or sewing; some, like
myself, are lolling in hammocks; even the
voices of the children have a certain monotonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>tone, in harmony with the stupid
heaviness of the day. Only the birds and
squirrels show any life or spirit; the former
are twittering above my head, courting, it
may be, or possibly discussing some detail
of household economy. They hop from
bough to bough, touch up their plumage,
and chirp in a cheerful, happy sort of
fashion, as if this was their especial
weather, as indeed it is. Up yonder tree,
a squirrel is racing about, in the exuberance
of his glee. He has done up his
work, no doubt, and now is off for a frolic.
I lie here, not a stone&#8217;s throw from him,
watching his merry antics, and rejoicing
to think how free from fear he is, when all
at once the leaves of his tree are cut by a
flying missile, and the next second I see my
gay fellow tumble headlong from the
bough, and fall in a helpless little heap on
the grass. I start up in affright, and hear
a passing boy call out to another, over the
way,</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought him down, Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Involuntarily I clinch my hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little coward!&#8221; I exclaim, &#8220;it is
<i>you</i> who should be brought down! You
are too mean to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughs brutally, and goes on, whistling
indifferently, while I pick up the dead
squirrel lying at my feet.</p>

<p>I find myself crying, before I know it.
Not alone with pity for the squirrel; something
else is hurting me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the masculine nature?&#8221; I ask
some one&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whom.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is one of those questions
which are flung upward, in a blind kind of
way, and which God sometimes catches
and answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they made this way? Was it
meant that they should be brutal?&#8221;</p>

<p>I am still holding the squirrel and thinking,
when I hear my name, and turning
see my neighbor over the way, Mrs. Purblind&#8217;s
brother, standing near me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Chance,&#8221; I say,
rather coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>All men are hateful to me at that moment;
to my mind they all have that boy&#8217;s
nature, though they keep it under cover
until they know you well, or have you in
their power.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little fellow is dead, I suppose,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answer with a sob which I
turn away to conceal. I don&#8217;t wish to excite
his mirth. Of course he would only
see something laughable in my grief, and
he couldn&#8217;t dream what I am thinking
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be too hard on the boy,
Miss Leigh,&#8221; he says quietly; &#8220;it was a
brutal act, but that same aggressiveness
will one day give him power to battle in
life against difficulties and temptations as
well. It will make him able to protect
those whom a kind Providence may put in
his charge. Just now he doesn&#8217;t know
what to do with the force, and evidently
has not had good teaching. I&#8217;m sorry he
did this; it hurts me to see an innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>creature harmed, and still more I am sorry
because it has hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is standing near me now, and as I
raise my eyes, I find him looking at me
with a sweet earnestness, that wins me not
only to forgive him for being a man, but
to feel that perhaps men are noble, after
all.</p>

<p>His look and tone linger with me long
after he has gone, as a cadence of music
may vibrate through the soul when both
musician and instrument are mute.</p>

<p>The day after this of which I have been
telling, I went to a picnic gotten up by
Mrs. Purblind, for the entertainment and
delectation of Mr. Purblind&#8217;s cousin, now
visiting her, a frivolous young thing, between
whom and myself there was not
even the weather in common, for she
would label &#8220;simply horrid&#8221; a lovely gray
day, containing all sorts of possibilities for
the imagination behind its mists and
clouds.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t care for this picnic, and didn&#8217;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>see why I was invited as most of the
guests were younger than myself. But it
was one of those cases where a refusal
might be misconstrued, and so I went.
We sat around the white tablecloth <i>en
masse</i>, for dinner; and in the course of the
passing of viands, Miss Sprig was asked
to help herself to olives that happened to
be near her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do, while you have opportunity,&#8221;
said Mrs. Purblind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always embrace opportunity,&#8221; replied
Miss Sprig with a simper. Whereat Mr.
Chance, sitting next her, suggested that,
as a synonym of opportunity, possibly he
might stand in its stead.</p>

<p>I detest such speeches, they are properly
termed soft, for they certainly are mushy&mdash;lacking
in stamina&mdash;fiber of any sort.
But I could have endured it, as I had endured
much else of the same sort that day,
had it not come from Mr. Chance. It
may be foolish of me, but his tone and his
words of the day before were still with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>me. They were so dignified, so sensible,
so manly, that I respected and admired
him. Up to that time I had not felt that
I knew him, but after he spoke in that
way, it seemed as if we were acquainted.
Now I saw how utterly mistaken I had
been, and I was mortified and disgusted.</p>

<p>The silly little speech I have quoted
was not all, by any means; there were
more of the same kind, and actions that
corresponded. Evidently he was one of
those instruments which are played upon at
will by the passing zephyr. With a self-respecting
woman, he was manly; with a
vapid, bold girl, he was silly and familiar.
I decided that I liked something more
stable, something that could be depended
upon.</p>

<p>I was placed in a difficult position just
then. Had I acted upon my impulse, I
should have risen and walked off&mdash;such
conduct is an affront to womanhood, I
think; but I was held in my place by a
fear&mdash;foolish, yet grounded, that my action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>would be regarded as an expression of
jealousy, the jealousy of an old maid, of a
woman much younger and prettier than
herself. This is but one of the many instances
of the injustice of the world. I
don&#8217;t think that I am addicted to jealousy,
but I may not know myself. Possibly I
might have felt jealous had I been eclipsed
by a beautiful or gifted woman, but it
would be impossible for me to experience
any such emotion on seeing a man with
whom I have but a slight acquaintance,
devote himself to a girl whom I should
regard as not only my mental inferior, but
also as beneath me morally and socially as
well. The only sensation of which I was
cognizant was a disgust toward the man,
and mortification over the mistaken estimate
of his character, that had led me, the
day before, to suppose him on a footing
with myself.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after dinner I
slipped away for a stroll. The place was
very lovely, and I felt that if I could creep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>off with Mother Nature, she would smooth
some cross-grained, fretful wrinkles that
were gathering in my mind, and were saddening
my soul. So when the folly and
jesting were at their height I dipped into
the thicket near at hand, and dodging here
and there, jumping fallen logs, and untangling
my way among the vines which
embraced the stern old woods like seductive
sirens, I at last struck a shaded path,
which erelong led me down through a
ravine to the waters of the big old lake.
It too had dined, but instead of yielding
itself to folly, was taking its siesta.
Across its tranquil bosom the zephyrs
played, stirring ripples and tiny eddies, as
dreams may stir lights and shadows on the
sleeping face.</p>

<p>I had not walked along the beach, with
the waves sighing at my feet, and whispering
all sorts of soothing nothings, for a
great distance, before I began to experience
that uncomfortable reaction which sometimes
arises from splitting in two, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>were, standing off at a distance and looking
oneself in the face. I realized that I
had been something of a prig and considerable
of a Pharisee. My late discomfort
was not caused by the fact that a young
girl had cheapened herself, but by the fact
that a man had demeaned himself and in
a manner involved me, inasmuch as I had
been led the day before by a false estimate
of his character to regard him as my social
equal. After all it was this last that hurt
most; it was my little self and not my
brother about whom I was chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>I am not naturally sentimental or morbid,
so I merely decided that internally I
had made a goose of myself and not shown
any surplus of nobility; and with a little
sigh of satisfaction that I had given the
small world about me no sign of my folly,
I dismissed the subject and betook myself
to an eager enjoyment of the day.</p>

<p>The soft June breeze played with my
hair and gently and affectionately touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>my face; the lake quivering and rippling
with passing emotions stretched away from
me toward that other shore which it kept
secreted somewhere on its farther side.
The very sight of it, with its shimmering
greens, turquoise blue, and tawny yellow,
cooled and soothed me, and ere I knew it,
I had slipped into a pleasant, active speculation
on matters of larger interest than
the petty subjects which had lined my
brow a moment before. I was walking
directly toward one of my families, and it
occurred to me that I might run in and
make a call, while I was near at hand. I
had first become interested in them at
church. I was impressed by their cleanliness
and regularity of attendance, and by
a certain judicious arrangement of their
children&mdash;the parents always sitting so as
to separate the latter by their authority
and order.</p>

<p>Another point that claimed my attention
was that the children were changed
each Sunday&mdash;a fresh three succeeding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>first bunch, and on the third Sunday, one
of the first three being added to a fresh
two, to make up the proper complement.
Both parents had a self-respecting, self-sacrificing
look, as of people who had
learned to help themselves cautiously from
the family dish, and to &#8220;put their knives
to their throats&#8221; before time; but kept all
this to themselves, asking nothing from
anyone, and making their little answer
without murmur or complaint. I had,
for some time, realized that the child who
was now getting more than his share of
sermons, by reappearing on the third Sunday,
would soon be reduced to the level of
his brethren, and a new relative would
take the place which he had been filling as
a matter of accommodation. I sought
occasion to make the acquaintance of the
mother of this fine brood, on the pretext of
some church work, and after that became
a regular visitor at their little home. The
perfect equality of the parents; the deference
with which they treated one another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>and their quiet happiness, in spite of all
labor and privation, made me realize that
they might well extend a pitying thought
to some of the apparently wealthy members
of the church. We may yet live to
see the day when a new scale shall come in
vogue, and some Cr[oe]sus who now stands
in an enviable light, shall then pass into his
true position, and become an object of pity.
Mere dollars and cents are a misleading
criterion of poverty and wealth.</p>

<p>I had seen my friends, and found that
the mother and her new nestling were in
comparative comfort, and I was on the
homeward stretch along the beach, when I
saw Mr. Chance walking toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was commissioned to look you up,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have been
of age for some years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he noticed the coolness in my
voice, and in some way I divined that he
knew the cause.</p>

<p>We went aboard our homeward-bound
train about 5 o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Mr. Chance helped me on, and evidently
expected to sit with me, but I thwarted
him by dropping down beside an elderly
lady, an acquaintance who happened to be
in that coach. I felt no grudge against
him, but I didn&#8217;t care to have him pass
from such a girl as Miss Sprig to me; his
conduct with her impaired his value somewhat
in my eyes. My elderly friend saw
and recognized the situation, I am sure,
and governed her later remarks accordingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Chance passed on, and took a seat
with one of the superfluous men, for contrary
to the rule on most such occasions,
the male gender was in excess of the
female. I had not expected him to return
to Miss Sprig; men always become satiated
with such girls, soon or late.</p>

<p>My elderly acquaintance entered upon
an animated conversation, that became
more and more personal, and finally
reached a climax when she leaned over,
and said in a semi-whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;My dear Miss Leigh, you ought to
marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been told this a number of times;
any one would suppose, to listen to some
of these women, that I had but to put out
my hand, and pluck a man from the nearest
bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you will marry some day,
but I&#8217;m afraid you may not choose wisely&#8221;&mdash;here
she lowered her voice again&mdash;&#8220;after
a man reaches thirty-five he becomes very
fixed in his ways, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
safe for a maiden lady to try to manage
him; it needs some one of more experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew she had Mr. Chance in mind,
and I was so indignant at being warned
against a man who had never shown the
first symptom of any such folly as addressing
me, that the blood mounted to my
hair.</p>

<p>Observing this, my elderly companion
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of any one, in particular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>my dear;&#8221; upon which I grew more
enraged, and the color in my face deepened
until I must have resembled an irate old
turkey gobbler&mdash;&#8220;not of any one in particular,
my dear; but on general principles,
I shouldn&#8217;t advise such a match. A widower
would be just the thing for you, and there
always are widowers, and every year the
list grows&mdash;death makes inroads, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>This idea, this hope of a second crop, as
I had passed beyond the first picking, was
comforting. I knew perfectly well whom
she had in mind for me&mdash;a nice fat little
widower, about fifty years old, who had
been held on the marital spit, until he was
done to a turn.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer was ended, and I was not
married. I am speaking now from the
standpoint of my neighbors; to my mind
life did not swing on this hinge. I had
my occupations&mdash;there were a goodly number
of needy folk to be looked after; there
was my reading; my music; my friends,
and other pleasures, and altogether I felt I
was very well off. Not that I was cynically
opposed to marriage; I intended to
marry, if the right man called, but if he
did not I was content to end life as I had
begun it&mdash;in single blessedness.</p>

<p>My neighbors, however, were of another
mind&mdash;I must marry; and they kept making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>efforts to find some one who would
fit, trying on one man after another, without
his consent or mine, something as one
would attempt to force clothes on a savage.</p>

<p>But in spite of all such friendly offices
the summer was ended, and I was not
married. I was thinking of it on this particular
day, as I stood gazing from the
window&mdash;thinking of it with a sort of
quiet wonder, for with an entire neighborhood
intent upon this end, it was rather
surprising that I was not double by this
time. Had they succeeded I should now
occupy a very different attitude. It is
only old bachelors and old maids who
speculate and theorize on marriage; when
people are really about it, they say little,
and (it would often appear) think less.</p>

<p>It was a day for speculation&mdash;this particular
one; the dead leaves were scurrying
up the street as people ran for a
train; a gusty wind was carrying all before
it for the time being, like an overbearing
debater. The trees shook and groaned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>recoiled and shuddered, like human creatures
in the blast; in their agitation dropping
hosts of leaves that immediately
slipped under covert, or else joined their
fellows in the race up town. The sky was
non-committal, and the lake looked dark
and secretive, as if it meditated wreck and
disaster.</p>

<p>It was only the middle of September,
but there had been several of these days&mdash;a
hint, perchance, of what was to come by
and by, as a gay waltz strain sometimes
dips into real life, and makes one look inward
for a moment.</p>

<p>The house did not invite me just at this
time, and the elements did; at least I felt
that rising within me which tempted me
forth to have a bout with them.</p>

<p>I was walking at a goodly pace along
the Boulevard&mdash;for I love the lake in
all its moods&mdash;when two men with anxious
faces overtook, and hurried past me.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a wreck, miss,&#8221; one of
them&mdash;a man I knew&mdash;called back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>I quickened my pace, trying to peer
through the sullen fog, as I ran. The
occasional dull boom of a gun called
&#8220;Help,&#8221; from out the grayness, with
pathetic persistency. Soon another sound
caught my ear, or rather vibrated through
my frame, for the ground beneath me
seemed to tremble, and I turned to see the
swift oncoming of the life-saving crew
from a station below us.</p>

<p>I had barely time to jump one side, before
the huge wagon, bearing the boat and
its men, swept past me, every one of those
splendid horses with his head lowered, and
his fine muscles set for the race.</p>

<p>It was all done with the celerity and
ease with which things are accomplished
in dreams. The sudden halting of the big
wagon; the swinging of the boat to the
ground; the swift donning of the yellow
oilskin suits by the crew; the launch, and
before one had time to wink, the strong
strokes in perfect time, that bore the boat
up and down, and up again, on those
tumultuous waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>There were other spectators beside myself,
standing with strained sight and
hearing, and throbbing hearts, upon the
strip of beach. And there were other
workers beside the crew. I had thought
we were a small community out there in
the little suburb, and I gazed with wonder
that morning at the crowd which seemed
to have dropped from the sky, or come up
from below.</p>

<p>The men were chiefly from the middle
and laboring classes, for the others go in
on early trains, but Randolph Chance was
there, his newspaper work giving him his
mornings. We spoke to one another, but
entered into no conversation. My thought
was with the doomed ship, and so was
his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will any of you boys join me in taking
off some of those people?&#8221; he asked the
men at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rough sea, Mr. Chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but I understand boating;
I guess we can manage it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the life-saving crew
can do the work?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered shortly, &#8220;there won&#8217;t
be time for them to make enough trips.
Come, boys, here she goes! Jump in, a half
dozen of you that can pull oars.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were boats enough, and soon
there were men enough, for the human
heart is kind and brave, and under a good
leader men will walk up to Death himself
without flinching.</p>

<p>Randolph Chance was big and strong,
alert, and self controlled&mdash;a good leader.
I realized all this just now, as I had not
before, and I thought how strange it was
that so much goodness should be bound up
with so much folly. It was the old story
of the wheat and the tares; and I said:
&#8220;An enemy hath done this,&#8221; and then I
thought of Miss Sprig.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like to dwell on that morning;
the experience was new to me, and I can&#8217;t
forget it; I can&#8217;t rid myself of the sound
of those shrieks when the ship went down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>She struggled like a human creature under
a sudden blow&mdash;rocked, tottered, quivered,
and then collapsed.</p>

<p>The little boats made five trips and
brought ashore almost all the passengers
and crew&mdash;all but one woman, and a little
child.</p>

<p>I was one of the many who received the
chilled and frightened victims of the storm,
and indeed, as soon as we were able to dispose
of the more delicate and needy ones,
we turned our thought to the brave crews
of the little boats, for their exertions had
been almost superhuman, and they were
well-nigh exhausted.</p>

<p>I bent over Randolph Chance, and
begged him to take a little brandy some
one had brought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to the women,&#8221; he said feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all cared for; I&#8217;m going to
look out for you now, Mr. Chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t feel so done up,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;if it weren&#8217;t for that woman. She
begged me to save her, and she had a little
child in her arms,&#8221; and his voice broke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think of her,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;you did all you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did my best to reach her, but
before I could get there, she went down.
I can never forget her face. Oh, at such
a time a fellow can&#8217;t help wishing he were
just a little quicker, and just a little
stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had risen from the beach where he
had flung himself or fallen, on leaving the
boat, but he fell again. I could plainly
see that the exhaustion from which he
suffered was due as much to mental distress
as to physical effort, and I thought
no less of him for that.</p>

<p>He was finally prevailed upon to get into
the wagon which had brought the life-saving
crew, and which was now loaded down
with the other boatmen, and many of the
passengers from the wreck, and so he was
taken home. And I walked back alone,
with a queer little feeling somewhere in
the region of my heart.</p>

<p>Man, after all, is a harp, I said to myself;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>a good player&mdash;the right woman can
draw forth wonderful music, but the
wrong woman will call out nothing but
discords.</p>

<p>Materials don&#8217;t count for everything;
there&#8217;s a deal in the cooking.</p>

<p>I was on my way home, when I met
two of my neighbors hurrying toward the
scene&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Daemon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too late,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only heard of it a little while ago;&#8221;
said Mrs. Daemon; &#8220;I was in the city, and
I met Mr. Daemon who had just been told
there was a wreck off this shore, and was
coming out to see it, so we both took the
first train.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hurried on, wishing to see what
they could, and I walked homeward.</p>

<p>Their appearance had slipped into my
reflections as neatly as a good illustration
slips into a discourse. I must tell you
their story, and then see if you dare say
man is not a harp, and woman not a
harpist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Years ago, when I was a child, I used
to see my mother wax indignant over the
wrongs inflicted upon one of her neighbors&mdash;a
gentle little woman whose backbone
evidently needed restarching. She was
the mother of three children, and should
have been a most happy wife, for her tastes
were domestic&mdash;her devotion to her family
unbounded. Unhappily, she was wedded
to a man of overbearing, tyrannical temper&mdash;one
of those ugly natures in which
meanness is generated by devotion. The
more he realized his power over his poor
little wife, the more he bullied her, and
beneath this treatment she faded, day by
day, until finally she closed her tired,
pathetic eyes forever. My mother used to
say she had no doubt the man was overwhelmed
by her death, and would have
suffered from remorse, but for the injudicious
zeal of some of the neighbors, who
were so wrought up by this culmination of
years of injustice and cruelty, that they
attacked him fore and aft, as it were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>creating a scandalous scene over the little
woman&#8217;s remains, accusing him of being
her murderer, and assigning him to the
warmest quarters in the nether world.
As a result of this outbreak of public opinion
the man hardened, and assumed a defiant
attitude which he continued to maintain
toward the neighbors for some years.
In the midst of all this furor, the sister of
the departed wife walked calm and still.
The power of the silent woman has often
been dwelt upon, but I really do not think
that half enough has been said, although I
am aware of committing an absurdity
when I recommend voluble speech on the
subject of silence. Jesting and paradoxes
aside, however, the silent woman wields a
power known only to the man toward
whom her silence is directed.</p>

<p>In this particular case the power was all
for the best. Erelong the sister-in-law
obtained such mastery over the forlorn
household that she held not only the fate
of the little ones, but that of the father as
well, in the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Two years slipped by, and then the
neighborhood that had dozed off, as it
were, awoke to hear that the sister was
going to marry that awful man.</p>

<p>At once the vigilance committee arose,
and took the case in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be possible,&#8221; it cried to the
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you know that he killed
your sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are going to marry him, in
face of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, he won&#8217;t kill me&#8221;&mdash;there was a
peculiar light in her eyes that puzzled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you want to marry such a
man for?&#8221; they cried, coming back to the
original question.</p>

<p>&#8220;To keep the children. If I don&#8217;t marry
him, some one else will, and those children
will go out of my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Her devotion to the motherless brood
had been past praise. There was nothing
more to be said, and if there had been it
would have availed nothing, for the sister
had a mind of her own. She was one of
those handsome women, who walk this
earth like queens, and to whom lesser folk
defer.</p>

<p>She married, and lo! the neighborhood
was agog once more, for strange stories
came floating from out that handsome
house, and it appeared for a time that instead
of his killing her she was like to kill
him.</p>

<p>I remember one tale in particular, which
my mother who, by the way, was no gossip,
and was as peaceable as a barnyard
fowl, was in the habit of rehearsing before
a chosen few, occasionally, with a quiet
relish that was amusing, considering the
fact that ordinarily any comment on her
neighbors&#8217; affairs was alien to her. It appeared
that after a short wedding trip,
during which the bridegroom had several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>times shown the cloven foot, the couple
returned to their domicile. Probably the
maids who had lived there for some years
and were devoted to the new wife, had
been warned of what was coming. At all
events, they accepted everything as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of the married pair&#8217;s
return, a handsome dinner was served.
The train was a trifle behind time; the
day had been cold, and several other untoward
circumstances had conspired to let
loose the bridegroom&#8217;s natural depravity.
An overdone roast served to touch off this
inflammable material.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash; these servants!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
kick every one of them through the front
window! Look at that roast!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doors being now open, a perfect
storm of ugly, evil tempers poured forth.</p>

<p>At such times as these it was the custom
of wife number one to shiver, shrink,
implore&mdash;weep, then take the offending
roast from the room, and replace it by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>something else which most likely was
hurled at her, in the end.</p>

<p>The present Mrs. Daemon neither shivered
nor shrank. She knew what to expect
when she married this man, and she
was ready. The guns were loaded and
aimed, and they went off, and presto! the
enemy lay dead on the dining room floor.</p>

<p>Instead of a roast beef solo, there was a
duet, Mrs. Daemon&#8217;s feminine soprano rising
above her husband&#8217;s masculine roar.
She agreed with what he said as to the disposition
of the servants, only adding that
she intended to hang them all, before he
put them through the front window.</p>

<p>&#8220;To insult us during our honeymoon
with such a roast,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;and look
at this gravy! It&#8217;s even worse!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with one swift stroke of her hand
she sent the gravy bowl flying from off
the table on to the handsome carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Heaven&#8217;s name, what are you
about?&#8221; he bawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d offer you such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>gravy; it ought to be flung in their
faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gasped and stammered; thought of
the recent wedding and regretted it; but
he was married now, and to an awful
shrew!</p>

<p>Soon after dinner they repaired to the
drawing room. In turning from the fireplace
he stumbled against a large, elegant
vase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound that thing!&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;I always did hate those vases that set on
the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; she chimed in, and putting
out her foot with an expressive jerk, she
kicked it over, and broke it into a hundred
fragments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see what you&#8217;ve done?&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;have you forgotten that that vase
was a present from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t, but we both hate it, and
what&#8217;s the use of keeping it?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was but the beginning; from that
time on, let him but murmur against a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>dish, and it was flung on to the floor; torrents
of abuse were poured upon the head
of a maid with whom he found fault;
some of the handsomest furniture in the
house was broken, the moment it gave
offense to him. In no vehemence was he
alone&mdash;his wife&#8217;s anathemas and abuse
joined and exceeded his, until&mdash;he had
enough of it&mdash;an overdose, in fact, and erelong
he turned a corner&mdash;came out of Hurricane
Gulch into Peaceful Lane, and he
hoped the latter would know no turning.
The servants whispered of times when he
would tell his wife of guests invited to the
house, and entreat her not to make a scene
while they were there.</p>

<p>Sixteen years have gone by, and this
woman is still above ground; stranger still
the man is alive as well; and strangest of
all, they are still under the same roof.
Indeed, if report and appearance are to be
trusted, Mr. Daemon is a model husband,
and Mrs. Daemon&#8217;s sudden and
amazing temper has spent itself and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>her a person of spirit indeed, but in nowise
unamiable, and least of all, an ugly character.</p>

<p>No one who saw them walk past me,
arm in arm, that morning, on their way to
the wreck, would have dreamed of their
past.</p>

<p>Truly, man <i>is</i> a harp, and truly, woman
does the harping.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been wandering about to-day
in an apparently aimless fashion, but in
reality &#8220;musing upon many things.&#8221; Our
horror of shiftlessness, and our realization
of the responsibilities of life, and of the important
work Providence has kept saving
up for us, or perhaps &#8220;growing up&#8221; for us,
like Dick Swiviller&#8217;s future mate, is expressed
in the fact that if we take an hour&#8217;s
leisure, anywhere betwixt sunrise and sunset,
we feel under bonds to explain the
matter not only to our own souls, but also
to those other souls who live adjacent, and
take an everlasting interest in ours.</p>

<p>Consequently, I told myself this day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>that I was not well&mdash;that I had been overdoing,
and that I had best &#8220;go easy for
a spell.&#8221; After which concession to my
interior governor, I proceeded to apologize
to my neighbors; to call my dogs&mdash;not to
apologize to them, but to solicit their company&mdash;and
then to hie me away to the
lake, remembering to walk feebly as long
as I was in sight.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t go down to the beach, but
plunged into the cool, comforting heart of
a ravine; fathomed its depths, with a feeling
of delightful seclusion, and came out
on the thither side, to find myself in the
glowing October woods.</p>

<p>Ill? I never felt better in my life!
Good, rich streams of blood coursed
through my veins, and painted a warm
tint in my cheeks. At that moment I hope
I looked a trifle like Nature, who was in
the height of her being; in a sort of tropical
luxuriance, like a beautiful woman at
the very summit of maturity and perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>I put out my hands toward a clump of
sumach&mdash;I was not cold, but its brilliant
warmth lured me as does a glowing fire.
It permeated my very being, and set my
soul a-throbbing.</p>

<p>There had been rain, and then warmth,
and October had caught all the prismatic
colors of the drops of water, and was giving
them forth with Southern prodigality.
The birds bent over the swaying daisies,
and sang soft love-notes into their great,
dark eyes, while I looked on in an ecstasy
of wonder and delight&mdash;the gold of the
daisies, the gold of the sunlight, and the
glow in my heart, seeming in a way all
one&mdash;part and parcel of the munificence
and cheering love of the Father. It is a
glorious world, and it is glorious to live
therein. The very air about me&mdash;the air
I was breathing in, seemed to palpitate
color and brilliant beauty.</p>

<p>I talked to Duke about it, and he looked
around him with a certain air of admiration
depicted on his noble, fond old face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Fanchon was frivolous, as usual, and
wanted to be running giddily about, hunting
rabbits and the like; but I made her sit
beside me, for it seemed a desecration
every time the October silence of those
woods was broken by aught save the
dropping of a ripened nut, or the whirr of
a homing bird.</p>

<p>It was at the close of this mellow day
that I sat in my library alone, before a
hickory fire. Alone, did I say? Nay,
Mrs. Simpson sat before me in the opposite
rocker. You could not have seen her, or
heard her, but she was there, and was
complaining of Mr. Simpson, saying he
rarely ever invited her to go anywhere;
and as she talked I recalled a certain
evening when I had been her guest&mdash;included
in an invitation to attend a spectacular
entertainment given by the country
club, at a spot some distance from our
homes, and I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Simpson, I can offer you some recipes
which I warrant you will work infallibly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>but they are like the recipe for
determining the interior condition of eggs,
which says, put them in water; if they are
bad they will either sink or swim&mdash;I have
forgotten which. Now try this recipe I
am about to give you, and it will either
make Mr. Simpson unwilling to take a
step in the way of recreation without you,
or it will make him stalk forth by himself,
as lonely as a crocus in early March&mdash;I
have forgotten which; but try it often
enough, and you will learn.&#8221;</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Recipe.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Fail to be ready at the appointed time,
and keep him waiting until he is either
raging or sullen; cudgel or dragoon the
children until their tempers are well on
edge. Then complain of the gait taken by
Mr. Simpson in order to catch the train;
declare frequently when aboard that you
are tired out, and are sorry you came.
After you reach the place, remark every
now and then that you don&#8217;t think the
entertainment amounts to much, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>you do think it was a piece of extravagance
to have given such a price for tickets to so-inferior
an exhibition. Next, declare that
you feel a draft, and are catching your
&#8216;death of cold;&#8217; interlard all this with frequent
directions to the children&mdash;admonitions
and complaints, and derogatory remarks
about Mr. Simpson&#8217;s appearance,
and wonder&mdash;oft-expressed and reiterated,
and put in the form of questions which
you insist upon his answering, as to why
he didn&#8217;t wear his other suit of clothes.
Finally, wind up the whole affair, by wishing
you were in bed, and announcing your
opinion that the trip didn&#8217;t pay, and you
are sure it will make you and the children
ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try this faithfully, and it won&#8217;t fail to
accomplish something decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>One more recipe.</p>

<p>I was talking to Mrs. Purblind now;
Mrs. Simpson had had her fill, and gone
home; and Mrs. Purblind had taken her
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>You couldn&#8217;t have seen her&mdash;but that
doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Recipe.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is for making a man love to stay at
home with you, and inducing him to be
cheerful and companionable, or for making
him flee your presence as one would
flee a plague-stricken city: I&#8217;ve forgotten
which, but you will soon discover, if you
try it persistently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk on disagreeable themes, talk persistently
and ceaselessly; never let up; the
more tired he may be the more steadily
you must talk, and the more irritating
your theme must be. Go to the gadfly;
consider her ways and be wise. Buzz,
buzz, buzz; sting, sting, sting.</p>

<p>&#8220;On his worst nights, always select his
relatives for your theme; harp upon their
faults; their failures in life; their humiliations;
the unpleasant things people say of
them. Then if he waxes irritable, express
surprise; remind him how he used to talk
against these same relatives, and how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>much trouble he gave them when he lived
at home; add that it&#8217;s plain now that he
has combined with his relatives against
you, and that you should be surprised if
he and they didn&#8217;t effect a separation. If
he is still in earshot, pass on to what he
once told you, beginning each remark
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then proceed to point out wherein
and howin he has utterly failed to make
good his promises. Further, if he is still
in the house, enlarge upon the change you
have noted in his conduct toward you&mdash;how
devoted he used to be, and how selfish
he has become. Next, tell him how well-dressed
other women are, and how little
you have on.</p>

<p>&#8220;By this time, if not sooner, he will remember
that he has night work clamoring
for him at the office, or that his presence
at the club is absolutely necessary, and it
would be well for you to conclude your
remarks by observing that if he bangs the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>front door so hard every time he goes out,
he will loosen the hinges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now,&#8221; said Mrs. Purblind&mdash;the
invisible Mrs. Purblind (she always would
listen to reason, which is more than could
be said for the visible creature of that
name), &#8220;well now, I know well enough
when I go on that way, that it isn&#8217;t best
to do it; but the Evil One seems to enter
me, and I get going, and I couldn&#8217;t stop
unless I bit my tongue off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bite it then,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and after that,
jump into the lake; were you once there,
your virtues would float, and your husband
would love them; but alive, your
virtues are beneath water, and your nagging
is always on top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is one to do? Supposing all
these things are true&mdash;supposing you suffer
from all these wrongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever right a wrong by setting
it before your husband in this way, and
at these times?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;Did you ever improve your condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But what would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up. Dip deep into silence. In
the first place, when you find you have
poor material, take extra care in the cooking;
study the art; use all the skill you
can acquire, and finally, if that won&#8217;t do,
if it <i>positively</i> won&#8217;t&mdash;if you can&#8217;t make a
decent dish out of him, open the kitchen
door, and heave him into the ash-barrel,
and the ash-man will cart him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have traveled a little in my life, and
have been entertained in various households.
I have seen wives who deserve
crowns of laurel, to compensate for the
crown of thorns they have worn for years;
but I have seen others, who had thorns
about them indeed, but they themselves
were not on the sharp end. Some
of these stupid, ignorant women fancied
they were doing everything possible to
make home pleasant, and wondered at
their failure. There they sat, prodding
their husbands with hat-pins, and grieved
over the poor wretches&#8217; irritability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>I recall a conversation I once overheard.
The husband arrived just at dinner time.
The wife heard him come in, and called to
him in a faint, dying voice, from the top
of the stairway&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;George, is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was spiritless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife came downstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, we can have dinner. I
don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s ready, though; Bridget
has had a toothache all day, and she&#8217;s just
good-for-nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this in the same faded tone of
voice.</p>

<p>The husband passed into the parlor, and
began to read the paper.</p>

<p>The weary tongue of his feminine partner
wagged on, in a dreary sort of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think these girls are so foolish; they
haven&#8217;t a bit of pluck. I&#8217;ve been trying to
persuade her to go to the dentist&#8217;s and
have her teeth out, but she won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m
just tired to death to-night, and there&#8217;s no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>end to the work; Bridget has been moaning
around all day&mdash;why her teeth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother her teeth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you care to hear anything
that goes on at home, George?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to hear about teeth that go
on at home; Bridget&#8217;s teeth especially. I
don&#8217;t care a rap for the whole set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How cross you are to-night, George!
when I&#8217;m so tired, too. Johnnie, your
face is dirty, go and wash it; be quick
now, for it&#8217;s time for dinner. I don&#8217;t
know that Bridget will ever call us. She&#8217;s
probably sitting out in the kitchen, nursing
her teeth; why she has five roots there,
and all of them so inflamed that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother her roots, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George, you are extremely irascible,
but that&#8217;s the way; I get no sympathy at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when you want it by the wholesale
for Bridget&#8217;s roots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what should we talk about? I
don&#8217;t see how we can ever have conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>in the home, if you won&#8217;t listen to
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they went on&mdash;the tired husband,
moody and irritable, and the tired wife,
loquacious about matters of no interest.
I felt sorry for her who spake, and him
who heard.</p>

<p>A husband worn out with the cares and
worries of an unsatisfactory business day,
and a wife harrassed and fretted by overwork
and petty annoyances, could succeed in
talking pleasantly together only by the use
of will-power and principle. It would require
a big effort, but the effort would pay.
It would be one of the best investments a
married pair could make. The returns
would be quick and large. I wonder more
don&#8217;t deposit in this bank.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> not forgotten Mr. Chance. This
fact annoyed me excessively, since I saw
that he had forgotten me. A forgotten
man may remember a woman, and preserve
his self-respect, if not his merriment;
but when a forgotten woman remembers a
man, that is quite another thing. Not that
I was brooding over Mr. Chance&mdash;far from
it; I thought very little of him, in one way,
for I frequently saw him with Miss Sprig;
but in spite of all that, I could not quite
forget the impression he made upon me
the day those boys killed the gay little
squirrel, and again the day the poor mother
went down into the deep, dark water with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>her child held close to her agonized heart.
The feeling I experienced for him on that
awful day, was unique in my history. I
had never been an impressionable girl as
far as men were concerned&mdash;I was not an
impressionable woman. For me to carry
the thought of a man home with me&mdash;for
me to dwell upon this thought, and above
all to take pleasure in dwelling upon it,
meant more than it would have meant for
some women. That was as far as the
matter had gone, but it was far enough&mdash;too
far, considering his evident indifference,
and I was humiliated, for the first
time in my life, over my attitude toward a
man. This mortification induced me to
treat Mr. Chance even more coldly than I
should have done ordinarily, though his
trifling with Miss Sprig would have called
forth some coolness of conduct under any
circumstances.</p>

<p>I had abundant opportunity to express
myself in this way, for Mr. Chance&#8217;s night
work necessitated late rising, and I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>him to speak to him almost every morning.
Indeed, I took some pains to be in
my garden during the forenoon, and from
this vantage ground I could not only see
much that took place between himself and
Miss Sprig, but I also had opportunity to
speak with him as he passed my house, on
his way to the train.</p>

<p>Sometimes Miss Sprig walked to the
station with him. He evidently absorbed
much of her time and thought, and she
evidently regarded him as her latest victim,
for she made him a common subject
of talk, and her entire acquaintance had
the pleasure of hearing the foolish things
he did and said. She always represented
him as deeply in love with her; I have no
doubt she really thought that he was.</p>

<p>For my own part, I cared very little
whether he was in love, as it is called, or
not. If he had succumbed to such a shallow-pated,
bold, common girl, I felt contempt
for him, and this contempt was
deepened when I realized that he might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>trifling with her. In any event it mortified
and angered me to think he had
been seen with me; (he had often called
upon me and we had been out together
several times), and that the old neighborhood
gossips had coupled our names. Now it
would be reported that Miss Sprig had cut
me out; if I was pleasant toward him,
they would wag their foolish old heads,
and whisper about my efforts to win him
back; if I was cool, they would shake
these same empty pates, and prattle about
my wounded affections. It was one of those
cases where you can&#8217;t possibly do the right
thing&mdash;I mean the thing that will silence
the clacking tongue: consequently, as luck
would have it, I plunged into the worst
possible course I could have taken, for
when Mrs. Catlin, who lived catacorner
from me, and who watched me as a cat
watches a mouse, said something one day
about Mr. Chance&#8217;s feeling bound to pay
attention to Mr. Purblind&#8217;s cousin, as long
as she was visiting there, and that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>knew such a girl wasn&#8217;t to his taste, and
she was sure he would come to his senses
soon, I was so angry that I lost control of
my temper, and all control of my wits,
and blazed out with:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my business or concern
whom he pays attention to, and for my part
I think they&#8217;re well mated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon, realizing I had made a
perfect fool of myself, and that this speech
of mine would go the rounds of the suburb,
and I could never erase it from the village
mind&mdash;not if I lived a hundred sensible
years, I had much ado to withhold myself
from seizing a pot of bachelors&#8217; buttons
that stood near, and breaking the whole
thing over Mrs. Catlin&#8217;s idiotic skull.</p>

<p>It was on top of this pleasant interview
with Mrs. Catlin, that Mr. Chance came
over, and asked me to attend a concert
that evening with himself and Miss Sprig,
and he very narrowly avoided receiving
the bachelors&#8217; buttons that Mrs. Catlin
had but just escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>I strode indoors, and began packing
some of my effects, for I was resolved to
move that day, or the next. Not because
I had discovered I had such fools for
neighbors&mdash;I had always known that&mdash;but
because I had just discovered that they
had a fool for a neighbor.</p>

<p>Worldly considerations prevailed with
me, and I took out the Penates that I had
slammed into a trunk, mended their
broken noses, and set them in place once
more; but I hid myself away for several
days, much as Moses was hidden, but for
a less dignified reason.</p>

<p>After a time, I cooled off, and decided
to accept the world as it stood, and not to
rage because the millennium did not come
before I was fitted to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purblind ran over one afternoon,
and I could see that she was far from
happy. I had noticed for some weeks
various changes in the direction of improvement,
in her care of her husband and
household. I had also noticed that Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>Purblind&#8217;s conduct did not keep pace with
these improvements, but I fancied Mrs.
Purblind was not sharp enough to see or
sensitive enough to care. In this it seems
I erred, as I have in one, or perhaps two,
other directions during my life.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Purblind, for the first time
since I have known her, didn&#8217;t seem to
care to talk, I took up a book at random,
and began reading aloud. As luck would
have it, I stumbled into some passages
descriptive of the ideal home, and before I
could stumble out again, the poor woman
burst into tears. I suppose that tender
little sentence served as the key that unlocked
the floodgates. As soon as her
grief had spent itself, she apologized, and
ascribed her tears to bad news in a letter
or something, and shortly afterward left.
I watched her walking down the street,
until my eyes were too dim to see her. It
grieved me sorely that the cause of her
sorrow was so deep, and so delicate that I
could not offer her my sympathy. Her tears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>were piteous to me, and I wanted to take her
to my heart, and tell her how sorry I was
for her; but to do that would have been to
take advantage of her moment of weakness,
and that I could not&mdash;must not do.
So I let her go from me with merely a few
commonplace expressions of regret that
she had received disturbing news, while
all the time my heart was aching in unison
with hers, and I kept her with me in
thought, all day.</p>

<p>I went down to the lake directly after
dinner; several things were troubling me,
and I wanted to lay my puzzled head on
Mother Nature&#8217;s bosom.</p>

<p>My run down the steep sides of the bluff
set the blood to coursing smartly through
my veins, and a new and more cheerful
stream of thought to flowing.</p>

<p>I was tired that night, and it was a luxury
to lie flat upon my back on the beach, listening
to the rhythmical thud of the big, long
wave at my feet, and the song of the stars
overhead. There is something unspeakably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>tranquillizing in the studded dome of
heaven; there is also something unspeakably
sad. It bends over the struggling,
yearning, aching human heart, as a
mother, who has attained that peace which
is the outgrowth of suffering, bends over
the passion, the sobbing, and the despair
of her child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, hush, it is all for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot&mdash;will not bear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, you know not what you say.
God&#8217;s hand is in it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no God in this, or if there is,
He hates me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my child, He loves you with unutterable
love, and pities with unutterable
pity. Yet a little while, and the day shall
shine upon you; then you will know&mdash;a
little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned from the great vault above me,
and looked out upon the restive waters,
and as I turned I saw a shadowy Mrs.
Purblind sitting beside me on the beach,
and questioning with sad eyes and heart,
the stars that bent to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;I have tried,&#8221; she said; her face, usually
so thoughtless, tear-stained, and quivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know you have tried,&#8221; I answered;
&#8220;I have seen that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and will be for a long time, and
you will have to go on trying for years, if
you want to carry him back to the old
days,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the hardest things in all
the world!&#8221; she cried passionately, &#8220;if we
stop doing right&mdash;the right stops with us,
but if we stop doing wrong and begin to
do right, the wrong goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for always,&#8221; I said, looking up to
the stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for so long!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great dome rich with gems, and
deep with peace, bent over her, and by
and by her sobs ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying, I know,&#8221; I reiterated,
&#8220;but you don&#8217;t understand&mdash;you can&#8217;t, for
you have only a woman&#8217;s nature.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;What should I have, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s, and a man&#8217;s, and a child&#8217;s,
to be a perfect wife and mother; that is,
you must be able to comprehend them all.
Your husband came home cross to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, irritable toward us all, and I so
hoped to have everything pleasant this
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He, too, had his hopes to-day, and they
were flung to the ground, and broken before
his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The special agent of a company that
he has for a year been working to get,
has been in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday this agent led him to suppose
he was to be the favored one. All to-day
he has been working toward that end,
and near night he heard that this man had
gone, without even saying good-by. You
remember that Mr. Purblind left home in
a hurry this morning, with scarcely a bite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>of breakfast; he took very little luncheon,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we had dinner at the usual time,
if he&#8217;d said he was hungry, I&#8217;d have hurried
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not hungry&mdash;he was much
more than that. Did you ever see a vessel
whose fuel is well-nigh exhausted drag
herself into port? What is the first thing
to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;replenish her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, put coal on board. Now when I
saw your husband walk up to his front
door, I said to myself, he needs coaling.
A good home should be a good coaling
station; remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of me?&#8221; she asked with some
impatience, &#8220;I, too, have my worries and
exertions&mdash;do I never need coaling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frequently,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who is to coal me, I should like
to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather one-sided, I think. Why
shouldn&#8217;t my husband look to that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; I said earnestly, &#8220;I never
knew but one man who saw when his wife
needed coaling, and attended to her wants.
When he died (for the gods loved him), it
was found that his shoulder-blades were
abnormally large&mdash;at least so the doctors
said, but I knew all the time that his wings
had budded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this life is too much for me,&#8221;
murmured Mrs. Purblind drearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t attempt the next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t, if I can help it, and yet I&#8217;m
like to soon, for Mr. Purblind&#8217;s mother is
coming on a visit to us, and I know she&#8217;ll
worry the breath out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I help it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By keeping the peace with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve tried that before; I&#8217;ve done
everything I could for her, and deferred to
her, and ignored myself until I seemed to
fade out of existence, but it didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it did, for it made her ten
times as troublesome as before.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&#8220;It certainly did, but what do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that a mother-in-law is like a
child, in that she is spoiled by having her
own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk calmly on, doing the best you
can, but recognizing your own authority
and dignity, and finally she will come to
recognize it. Be mistress of your own
household, and director of your own children&mdash;all
this quietly and pleasantly, but
without wavering, and in the end she will
respect and probably admire you, though
she will never think you do just right, or
are just the woman who ought to have
married her son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve always been in hopes of making
her love me as she loves her own
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what every romantic woman
starts out with, but by and by, in the
storm and stress of domestic life, that ideal
is cast overboard, as a struggling ship
throws its extra cargo over the rail.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Why is it, I wonder, a man never
fights with his father-in-law. Men are
said to be naturally pugnacious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a mistake, my dear; a man
would go several miles any day to
avoid a fuss; it is we women who delight
in scraps. A man occasionally has a little
set-to with the girl&#8217;s father, before he gains
his consent to the engagement, but once
he&#8217;s married, it&#8217;s the old lady he has to
train for, or I should say who trains for
him, because as a general thing it is she who
gives battle, not he. The real conflict,
however, takes place between the two
women&mdash;the wife and her mother-in-law.
If you want to see &#8216;de fur fly,&#8217; as the
darkies say, you must always come over
to the feminine side of the house. Then
you&#8217;ll have your fill of explanations, expostulations,
and recriminations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, certainly I never had any trouble
with my father-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble! Do you know what I&#8217;d do, if
I had a troublesome father-in-law?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8220;No&mdash;murder him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder him, indeed! Woman, have
you no mercantile instinct? That would
be like killing the goose that lays the
golden egg. Why, the first showman
would take the old gentleman off my
hands, and pay me a handsome price for
him. You must know that a troublesome
father-in-law is so rare that the public
would flock to see him. But you couldn&#8217;t
get anything for a troublesome mother-in-law.
There are too many families trying
to get rid of them, at any price. The sale
of parents-in-law is governed by the same
laws as other commodities, and these interfering,
mischief-making mothers-in-law
have become a drug in the market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is Mrs. Earnest, her
mother-in-law is a jewel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now you mention a most valuable
piece of property, for a woman like that&mdash;who
models her conduct on the pattern of
Aunt Betsey Trotwood, in David Copperfield&#8217;s
household, is a jewel of such magnitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>and brilliancy, that she will some day
be seen sparkling in Abraham&#8217;s bosom,
from a distance of millions of miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how would you cook mothers-in-law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a delicious dish of your husband
and then take a pinch&mdash;a good pinch&mdash;of
mother-in-law, and throw her in as &#8216;sass.&#8217;
Speaking of this, remember that too many
cooks spoil the broth, and wife and mother-in-law
combined generally make a pretty
mess of the husband.&#8221;</p>

<a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> feeling a trifle dull and heavy one
afternoon, and after several vain efforts to
do good work, decided that a vigorous
tramp would set my blood to flowing, and
the wheels of my thinking mill to revolving.
So out I started toward the lake, as
usual. There had been a storm off the
Michigan shore, and we were just beginning
to get evidence of it, in the big
waves that were tumbling on the beach,
I like the lake in this mood&mdash;in any mood,
indeed, but especially when it is rough and
wild.</p>

<p>After quite a brisk tramp along, or near
the beach, I turned back; but before going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>home again, I wished to come in closer
contact with the tumultuous waters. At
risk of being wet by the spray, which the
waves were tossing on high, much as an
excited horse tosses the foam from his
chafing mouth, I climbed around the little
bathing house, set on the shore end of the
pier, and then boldly walked out, and took
my seat in the midst of the tumult.</p>

<p>The passion of the lake was magnificent;
far out&mdash;as far as eye could stretch&mdash;there
were oncoming waves; the clan was gathering,
and all in battle array. What an
overwhelming charge they made! Surely
no one could resist that onslaught. There
was no deliberation, as was usual with a
moderately heavy sea; no calm, inevitable
heaving of the water; no steady rising,
ever higher and higher, until it crested,
curved, and fell with a boom. There was
nothing of this to-day; no preparation;
everything was ready; the warriors,
armed and mounted, were already making
the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>For a time I gloried in it all; even the
anger of the waves was more admirable
than terrific in my sight. It seemed as
though they interpreted my boldness as defiance,
and accepted the challenge. From
near, from far, they were coming, and all
upon me, or if that is taking too much to
myself, they were making their attack
upon the shore, meaning to claim it for
their own, and incidentally to sweep me,
a poor, insignificant atom, from their sight.</p>

<p>By and by I found myself oppressed with
the desolation of the scene. As the day
waned, and the chill that foreshadows
night fell upon me, or rather rose upon me,
from the cold waters, I began to feel
lonely and unprotected. The waves
looked so hungry, so cruel; they reached
out and up toward me; they encircled
with the inevitable, as with a relentless
fate. I began to be afraid of them, and I
rose to go back to shore.</p>

<p>Unlike the ocean, the lake is fixed; but
that day the increase of the waves, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>height and fury, had the effect of a rising
tide. I realized that it would be very difficult
for me to get off the pier alone, and I
was more than relieved to see Randolph
Chance, who had come down for a look at
the lake before taking his train to the city.
He joined me without trouble; a man can
perform those feats so easily, whereas a
woman is physically hampered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in rather a bleak place, Miss
Leigh,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have just begun to realize that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we&#8217;ll manage to get off safely;
but you mustn&#8217;t mind a little wetting.
Just give yourself to me, and we&#8217;ll be on
shore in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gladly did as he bade me; it was
luxury just then to have some one as
strong and capable as he take the reins.
He led me around the bathing house, and
then lifted me from the pier. As he set
me safely on the shore, his eyes met mine,
and his look was a revelation to me. I
was, for a moment, too startled to think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>and the strangest sensation I ever experienced
crept over me. If a look could
speak, Randolph Chance&mdash;but I did not
put it into words&mdash;not then, at least, but it
was all very strange to me&mdash;most inexplicable.</p>

<p>We walked on quietly, both, I dare say,
feeling our silence to be a trifle awkward.
It was for this reason that I decided to
shorten the time of our being together, by
stopping at the house of a friend. The
wetting I had received from the waves
did not amount to anything for one so
hardy as myself, so I was not deterred on
that account.</p>

<p>The house where I stopped was a pleasant
resort for me. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Bachelor were interesting people. I had
known Mr. Bachelor for fifteen years. He
had once been one of our young men, as
the saying is, young merely in the sense
of being single, not in actual years, for at
the time I met him he was nearer the forty
than the thirty line. Nature seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>have marked him for single&mdash;cussedness, I
had almost said, from the first. He was
no favorite with any set, being grumpy,
fussy, and peculiar. But five years after he
rose into sight above my horizon he married
a most sensible, lovely woman; not a
child, by the way, for she was almost
forty; and in less than no time, it
seemed to us, had a family of four children
about him, one following the other so
closely that the predecessor was all but
overtaken. At first we said among ourselves
that he must have borrowed these
infants, and stuck them up in his home for
appearance&#8217;s sake, in some such manner as
the proprietor of a summer hotel once
stuck a number of trees in his grounds, to
make a sandy, barren spot seem fertile
and enticing. But by and by we became
convinced that these little human shoots
were his very own, not alone because they
evinced some disagreeable crotchets similar
to his, but also because of the love he bore
them, and the change they wrought in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>character and life. Even around court
the man was regarded differently; warmth
and esteem being extended him now in
place of the dislike he had formerly
aroused. He had never ceased to be a
study to me, and a certain flavor of
romance hung about his home&mdash;a delightful
flavor, that made it an attractive visiting
spot. So it was with considerable pleasure
that I called upon this particular day.</p>

<p>I was shown into the parlor&mdash;a comfortable
room, back of which was a most home-like
apartment, called the study. As I sat
there, awaiting Mrs. Bachelor&#8217;s coming, I
noticed that her husband&#8217;s desk, which
stood in the center of the study, was
strewn with dolls, and paraphernalia closely
related thereto. My observations were interrupted
by the entrance of Mrs. Bachelor,
who welcomed me in her cordial,
cheery way. A minute later Mr. Bachelor
came in, and gave me what was for him,
a most friendly greeting. He excused
himself in a little while, and went into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>study. He had, so his wife explained,
been ill with a cold for a day or two, and
had been working at home the while, to
make ready for the approaching trial of an
important case.</p>

<p>Upon his entering the study, a scene
occurred which I shall endeavor to give you
as near to the life as possible. As a matter
of course he steered directly for his
desk, and his eye immediately fell upon a
quantity of grandchildren, variously disposed
thereon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;if
this isn&#8217;t outrageous!&#8221; and he gathered up
the whole crop&mdash;there were fully a dozen
dolls, in all stages of development, and
much doll furniture, and toggery of all
kinds.</p>

<p>After dumping the obnoxious elements
on to a divan, he returned to his desk, and
with much grumbling sorted out his law-papers,
and went to work. But soon after
he had cleared his visage, as it were, his
small daughter&mdash;a pretty child, four years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>old&mdash;ran into the room hugging two puggy
puppies, and two kittens of tender age.
It did not take her long to grasp the situation.
Running to the divan, she uttered a
series of cries, indicative both of alarm and
displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what&mdash;what is the matter?&#8221;
said Mr. Bachelor, who had probably forgotten
his offense by this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You naughty papa!&#8221; cried the child;
&#8220;what did you disturve my dollies for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you put them on my desk
for?&#8221; queried her father indignantly;
&#8220;the idea! I haven&#8217;t a spot on earth I can
call my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve just mussed their best frocks
all up,&#8221; continued the child, who, without
paying the slightest attention to her father&#8217;s
vigorous protest, was rapidly replacing her
family, puppies, kittens, and all, on the
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t have them here! I
have important papers around, and I must
be allowed to work in peace. Take them
off!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>He started to sweep them on to the floor,
but the little girl uttered a shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, papa, don&#8217;t,&#8221; she screamed.
Then, as he desisted, she added, &#8220;They&#8217;ve
just <i>dot</i> to be here&mdash;it&#8217;s the bestest, highest
table, and the little doggies and kitties
can&#8217;t jump off, and I&#8217;m doing to have a
tea-party with Mamie Williams. You
must put your nasty old papers somewhere
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an outrage!&#8221; he exclaimed,
standing up and declaiming as if he were
in court; &#8220;this is imposition run riot; it
has reached a climax, and I&#8217;ll endure it no
longer. Evidently I have no rights that
even the smallest and youngest in the
household is bound to respect. It is a
notorious fact that I am ruled with a rod
of iron, and that even this baby of the
family flouts me. I say I will stand it no
longer. I have been held with a tight
rein, and a curb bit, but I will turn at
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his excitement, his metaphors became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>confused, horses and worms being all
mixed up in a heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the desk, take the whole of it,
and to-morrow I shall leave the house! I
shall go back to my bachelor quarters,
where I once lived in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child regarded him seriously, from
out her great, brown eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go away, papa,&#8221; she said at
last, &#8220;you may have a little of your desk,
if you won&#8217;t take too much. I didn&#8217;t
mean to be cross at you,&#8221; she added, with
a pathetic quiver of her lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; exclaimed the father hastily,
&#8220;there, there!&#8221; and he laid his hand
softly on her curly little head, &#8220;I guess
we&#8217;ll get on somehow; if I can have a part
of the desk, that&#8217;ll answer. It&#8217;s big enough
for two, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he began moving his papers around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not there, papa,&#8221; said the little tyrant;
&#8220;no, that&#8217;s the sunny side, and little
bowwow must be there, &#8217;cause he&#8217;s dot the
badest cold, and the kitties haven&#8217;t dot but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>little weeny eyes yet, and they <i>must</i> be
where it&#8217;s most lightest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well, where <i>may</i> I sit? I
must get to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may sit right there, and you
mustn&#8217;t fiddet, &#8217;cause you&#8217;ll upset dolly&#8217;s
crib, if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon he was safely bestowed, off on one
side, and as he obediently kept to his limitations,
all proceeded happily.</p>

<p>During this domestic scrimmage, Mrs.
Bachelor went on chatting in her lively,
pleasant fashion with me, never betraying,
in any way, that she overheard the scene
in the study. I was so occupied with it,
that I could pay no heed to her remarks;
but she was a wise woman, and knew that
her husband was being cooked to a delicious
turn, and that any interference on her
part, would spoil the dish. I have since
learned that occasionally, when she sees
that the fire is really too hot for him, she
comes to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he sputters and fizzes, don&#8217;t be anxious;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>some husbands do this till they are
quite done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently Mrs. Bachelor has studied her
cook-book.</p>

<a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little touch of sentiment that
flashed, as it were, from Randolph Chance
as he lifted me off the pier, was presently
blotted, as far as effect upon me was concerned,
by the return of Miss Sprig to the
Purblind household, and the renewal of
his attentions to her. At least I regarded
them as renewed, and I coldly turned my
back upon him, and let him go his way,
without further thought or speculation.</p>

<p>I was daily becoming more interested in
another acquaintance&mdash;Mr. Gregory, a
man of years, whom I had known for
some time. He had been a visitor at our
house when my parents were living, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>had, from time to time, shown me friendly
attentions since their death. He frequently
invited me to places of entertainment, something
Randolph Chance seldom did, and in
many ways contributed to my comfort and
happiness. Single women are very dependent
upon their men friends for pleasures
of this sort; few of them care to go out at
night alone, and even when they go in
company with each other, the occasion
lacks a zest which belongs to it when a
woman has an escort. It is strange that
many men&mdash;many of those who believe in
the dependence of women, fall into the selfish
habit of going alone to theater, concert,
and lecture, and so force the women
of their acquaintance into a position which
their sentiments would seem to deprecate.</p>

<p>While in no way obtrusive, or gushing
in his attentions, Mr. Gregory was most
thoughtful and kind, and few women are
without appreciation of conduct of this
type.</p>

<p>Life flowed on with me with a quiet current.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>I was not a woman to make scenes
with myself or others, and my circumstances
were such as to permit of an undisturbed
tenor of way.</p>

<p>One bright afternoon, just as I returned
from a long walk, Mrs. Purblind ran over
to see me, and soon afterward, Mrs. Cynic
dropped in. I never could bear this latter
woman; something malevolent seems to
emanate from her; something that is more
or less unhealthful to the moral nature of
all who come in contact with it, just as the
miasma from a swamp is poisonous to the
physical being.</p>

<p>It chanced that I had just finished writing
a little story, drawn from the life-page
of my domestic experience; it was so endeared
to my memory that I was not like
to forget it, and yet, in the course of years,
its outlines would probably fade a trifle if
I did not take care to preserve their distinctness;
for that reason I had written it
out.</p>

<p>I ought to have had better sense than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>read anything of this kind to Mrs. Cynic.
In the presence of such people, that which
is fresh, beautiful, and holy withers, as a
cluster of dewy wild flowers is parched
and killed by the hot, sterile breath of a
furnace.</p>

<p>Usually I have some judgment in such
matters, but that day all discretion seemed
to take wings.</p>

<p>A remark of Mrs. Purblind&#8217;s led up to
the subject. This little woman can say
ugly things at times, but they are stung
out of her, as it were, by some particular
hurt, and are not the expression of her real
nature. She has a kind, good heart,
though her judgment and tact are somewhat
lacking.</p>

<p>We happened to be speaking of men,
and something was said about their capacity
for devotion, when Mrs. Purblind exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Devotion! the masculine nature doesn&#8217;t
know the meaning of the word, unless it
is devotion to self.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;I must read you a little story I&#8217;ve written
to-day. It&#8217;s a true one, remember&mdash;I
think I shall call it, &#8216;Devotion&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to my desk, took out the manuscript,
and read as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;A few years ago I owned a pair of foxhounds.
Duke was the gentleman of the
family, and Lady was his consort, and a
lady she was indeed. I can hardly imagine
a human creature of greater intelligence
and refinement than this dumb
beast. The attachment between herself
and Duke was unique in its strength, and
in its demonstration. He was fully as
noble and as intelligent as she, but of a
less lively, cheerful temperament. The
arrival of six little Dukes was an occasion
of anxiety and excitement for us all, and
we were much relieved when the event
was safely over, and we saw Lady and her
beautiful family established in peace and
comfort. Matters had run smoothly for
about four or five weeks, when one day I
was startled by a series of sharp yelps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>which I knew came from Lady. I ran to
the window, and saw the poor creature
rolling in the middle of the street, in the
greatest pain. By her side was Duke, and
his outcries mingled with hers. The hard-hearted
teamster, whose wagon had done
the mischief, had driven off, but I ran to
the rescue, and finally got her into the
stable, where her little ones were awaiting
her. She only lived a few hours, and her
last act was an effort to nurse her clamorous
doggies, while with her great, sad eyes
she seemed to say good-by to Duke! The
grief of this noble fellow was so great that
we thought he would go mad. For a time
he refused to let us come near her. He
stood over her, licking her senseless form,
pushing her gently once in a while with his
head and paws, and then uttering lamentable
cries when he saw that she did not
move, or in any way respond; and meanwhile
the tiny dogs were crawling over
her, and mingling their voices with their
father&#8217;s deep notes of distress. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>most pitiable sight, and we all breathed a
sigh of relief when the dear old fellow permitted
us to lead him off into the house,
and we had an opportunity to dispose of
poor Lady. I&#8217;ll not try to tell of Duke&#8217;s
excitement and distress when he missed
her; of his frantic search all over the place,
and of how we followed him about,
and talked to him, and tried to divert him;
or how we all&mdash;Duke, and the rest of us,
finally sat down in the stable, beside the
motherless little family, and wept together.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning after Lady died, I went
out to the stable with a cup of warm milk.
I had not been able to do anything with
the puggy little dogs the evening before,
but I thought that their sharp hunger,
after several hours of abstinence, would
lead them to make an effort to drink. I
carried a spoon with me, also a rag to suck,
and a bottle, with a nipple&mdash;all kinds of
appliances, in fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was my surprise upon entering
the stable, to find Duke occupying Lady&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>place. He was evidently trying to answer
the small dogs&#8217; clamorous demand for
breakfast, and it was also plain that his
failure in this respect amazed and bewildered
him. He lay down just as he had
seen Lady do, and when this did not
suffice he tried another position; failing
again, he withdrew a few paces, and sat
for a moment in an attitude of profound
thought; returning soon, and trying another
device. This resulting unfavorably,
he made still another, and then another
attempt, and finally, grieved to the heart,
and worried by the hungry cries of the
small dogs, he withdrew once more, and
lifting his nose high in air, deliberately
yowled.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this point I obtruded myself upon
the scene and went up to the dear old
dog, took his distressed head in my arms,
and talked to him. I explained to him the
difficulty of the situation; how, owing to
circumstances quite beyond his control, he
could not take Lady&#8217;s place. I urged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>upon him that he must yield gracefully to
his limitations; showed him my appliances,
and then when I had soothed and interested
him, and he had consented to desist,
and let me try, I made my essay.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a study for an artist&mdash;my appealing,
pitying, impatient, scolding efforts to
induce those unreasonable little creatures
to accept a rag, or a bottle in place of a
mother. I shouldn&#8217;t have cared so much,
that is, I could have taken longer without
minding it, had it not been for Duke. His
anxiety was so great, and his distress over
their cries so keen, that I was quite unnerved,
and as is often the case, I showed
my concern by scolding and abusing the
objects in whose behalf I was exerting
myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was all but ready to give up, when
one of the smallest and liveliest of the puppies
(a feminine creature, of course) suddenly
seized upon the nipple of the bottle
with a lusty grip, and sucked away till she
was all but strangled with milk. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>example was speedily followed by the
others, but before I had gone the rounds
Duke comprehended that our trials were
ended, and then&mdash;well, the dignified, sad-faced
old doggie took leave of his wits,
temporarily, as well as his dignity. He capered,
he rolled on the ground, he barked,
he bayed, he played leap-frog over my
head, did everything but stand on end,
and very nearly that, in his joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;From that time on he never failed to be
present when his infants were fed, and
when I weaned them, and taught them to
drink, he was an interested spectator;
helpful too, for one time when a small dog
was obdurate, he took him by the nape of
the neck, and shook him thoroughly, before
turning him over to me for another
trial. On another occasion, the pig of the
family drank too deep, as it were, from
the flowing bowl, and might have been
drowned had it not been for his watchful
parent. Duke noticed that the small fore-quarters
were plunged into the liquid dinner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>he also observed that the hind quarters
were slowly rising in midair. He watched
all this, with his accustomed, kindly gravity,
until the equilibrium was lost, and
Master Pup plunged into the pearly sea.
Then the startled father leaped to his feet,
snatched his offspring from a milky grave,
and laid him, sneezing and choking, sadder
and wiser, on the sunny grass-plat to
dry.</p>

<p>&#8220;In due time Duke recovered, in a measure,
from his grief over Lady&#8217;s death, and
took unto himself another partner. As is
usual in the case of widowers, his second
choice was injudicious, for Fanchon was a
giddy, young thing, that didn&#8217;t have sense
enough to come in out of the rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Duke saw no defects; he was all
tenderness and attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was early winter, but the weather
was intensely cold, and we had taken
Duke and Fanchon in from the stable, and
had housed them comfortably in the cellar.</p>

<p>&#8220;One night I was wakened out of a sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>sleep by cries of distress. I called my
sister and her husband, who were visiting
me, and in various costumes, all hands went
below. Fanchon was running about, crying
and moaning, and Duke was alternately
making frantic efforts to soothe her, and
kiyiying in a manner that was fearful to
hear. We succeeded at last in getting
Fanchon to heed us, and coaxed her to
settle down in a comfortable bed we made
for her on the far side of the cellar, where
she would have the benefit of the warmth
from the furnace, and would be out of the
way of the cold air which came in through
a window, broken the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as she was pacified, Duke was
again happy, and he cheerfully lay down
to rest. We retired to our rooms, and
being very weary, with much sightseeing
during the day, dropped into a sound sleep.
The next morning I hurried down into the
cellar, wondering whether I should see two
dogs, or a dozen. To my surprise and
dismay, I saw none at all. The cellar was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>silent and deserted. I opened the outer
door, and with a failing heart, stepped
into the clear, bitter cold of a temperature
something like fifteen degrees below zero.
Just around the corner of the house, in a
nook slightly sheltered from the biting air,
I came upon the family. Fanchon lay
upon the ground, the snow carefully
pushed up around her, and her clinging
little ones, who were taking their breakfast.
Over all&mdash;Fanchon and her puppies&mdash;covering
them with his faithful body&mdash;shielding
them with his never-failing love
and devotion, was my noble hound&mdash;as
noble, as faithful a dog, as ever man or
woman loved. I called to him, and rubbed
him, but all in vain, and meanwhile
stupid, silly Fanchon, that had foolishly
left her warm bed in the cellar, looked on
with cheerful indifference, and wagged
her tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Cynic, when I had
concluded the reading, &#8220;that story seems
to me to prove but one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;And what is that, pray?&#8221; I asked,
realizing I had been foolish to read such a
tale to such an auditor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the truth of Madame de Sta&euml;l&#8217;s
remark: &#8216;The more I see of men, the
more I admire dogs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>That hateful woman! She always
leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.
I know she springs from some corrupt
ancestry. She has all the marks of inward
decay upon her.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Mrs. Purblind and
I breathed more freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t believe in anything good,&#8221;
said Mrs. Purblind.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered in a tone of disgust,
&#8220;she has nothing within her to answer to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How different she is from Mrs. Earnest,&#8221;
continued Mrs. Purblind; &#8220;why, you
can hardly convince that woman that anyone
is really mean, and goodness knows
she has trouble enough to make her bitter.
What a husband she&#8217;s got! That man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>makes me so mad! He&#8217;s ugly from sheer
badness.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought for a moment, and then I assented.
I really do believe that man is
ugly without cause. He and his wife live
at some distance from us, and I&#8217;ve often
visited them. I should like to give you a
scene to which I was witness one evening
when I was a trifle ill, and lay on a divan
just out of their dining room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Earnest is like a delicate flower
that lifts its pretty face and smiles in the
sunlight of love, but is bowed and broken
&#8217;neath the thunder-cloud and storm. She
longs to make her home attractive, but her
husband has no sympathy with this desire;
to him home is merely the place
where he finds food and lodging, and a
safety valve for such moods and tempers
as he is obliged to keep under control in
the business world.</p>

<p>The efforts that this poor little wife
makes, in her timid way, to start up pleasant
subjects of conversation would move a
rock to tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>This is the scene, as I recall it&mdash;a specimen
scene.</p>

<p>The family&mdash;husband, wife, and three
little children were at dinner, as I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been happening to-day? anything
of interest?&#8221; asked the little wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; was the gruff
reply.</p>

<p>Silence, broken by the occasional sound
of eating implements, ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass the bread, will you?&#8221; he said in
a short tone, directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how you like this bread; we are
trying the entire wheat flour. I think it&#8217;s
very nice tasting, and they claim it&#8217;s rich
in nutrition. It&#8217;s warranted to make
blood, bone, and muscle&mdash;brain, too, I believe.
I&#8217;m going to eat several pounds a
day; I may astonish the world yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>This feeble joke was received in stolid
silence, and the poor little wife crept into
her shell.</p>

<p>After a time she peeped out again, and
made another effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>&#8220;I went to the womans&#8217; club this afternoon;
Mrs. Pierson invited me. They
had a very interesting meeting; they
brought up the subject of smoke consumers.
I never realized before how much
property is ruined yearly by the smoke.
It does seem as if manufacturers ought to
use consumers.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Bruin openly yawned, and
the little wife again retired. But with astonishing
elasticity of courage she issued
from her shell once more, this time with
the hope that a more masculine theme
would meet with some response.</p>

<p>&#8220;They brought a petition around here
to-day for us to sign. It seems there is
some talk of flooring the reservoir and
using it as a beer garden this coming summer,
and the neighborhood has been called
upon to protest against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about that,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you signed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again silence fell as a wet cloak upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>them, and the little woman sat there racking
her brains, almost depleted by this
time, for the atmosphere which such a
man as that creates is warranted to dry
up all the intellectual juices.</p>

<p>One more despairing effort. The children
had now left the table, so anecdotes
of them were in order. Probably the poor
little wife thought that this man could be
wakened into attention by a story about
one of his children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamie asked me where cats went to
when they died. &#8216;They don&#8217;t go anywhere,&#8217;
I said; &#8216;when they die, that&#8217;s the
end of them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do they turn to dust?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, just turn to dust,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, then,&#8217; she exclaimed, and her
eyes grew as big as saucers, &#8216;when horses
run &#8217;long the streets, are they kicking up
cats?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>All the man said was, &#8220;Umph,&#8221; and the
little wife&#8217;s peal of merry laughter was
checked, and the ha ha&#8217;s grew fainter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>spread farther and farther apart, until they
died away altogether, and I felt like charging
upon that burly, surly demon, and
butting him out of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you serve such a man, if
you were his wife?&#8221; asked Mrs. Purblind.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Roasted!</i>&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gregory&#8217;s</span> attentions had become
an accepted fact in my life. They were
dignified and steadfast, and I received
them with a certain calm pleasure. They
had not, as yet, reached the point of declaration,
but it was clear to me, and to everyone
else, who knew anything about the
matter, that they were tending thither,
and my own thought had reached the point
of acceptance. I had the greatest respect
for him as a man; we were congenial in our
tastes, and personally agreeable to one another.
The position he had to offer me
was a most dignified, desirable one, as he
was not only a man of sterling integrity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>but also a man of wealth; there was, in
short, everything in favor of the alliance,
and I looked upon it quietly, but with a
sense of substantial, and steadfast comfort.</p>

<p>Such an event as a marriage cannot
even in prospect, face a thoughtful woman
without making a great change in her life.
Mr. Gregory was that type of man who
ought not to be allowed to offer himself in
a direction where there was no intention
of acceptance, for his character and age&mdash;he
was fifty or more&mdash;forbade all thought
of lightness or trifling, and gave one the
assurance that any marked attention he
might show, was significant. My acquaintance
with him had extended over
several years, and during this period there
had been abundant opportunity, on both
sides, for study of character.</p>

<p>In a quiet way, I had been arranging
my affairs, preparatory to my expected
change in manner of life. I had, as a
matter of course, done considerable thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>during this time. I had experienced
none of the rapture always associated with
a romantic attachment, but I was quietly
happy, and this condition was a far more
natural one for me, with my cool, matter-of-fact
temperament&mdash;a far more promising
one, in respect to future enjoyment, I felt,
than something more ecstatic.</p>

<p>I had seen but little of Mr. Chance for
some weeks. He had called several times,
but on each of these occasions, we had
passed a somewhat constrained, and I
thought, a rather dull evening. Just why
this constraint should have crept into our
intercourse when we seemed to be coming
to a better understanding than heretofore,
and were beginning to enjoy a warmer degree
of friendship than we had known, I
could not understand; but its presence was
undeniable, and it spoiled everything for
me, as far as he was concerned, causing
me to look upon his calls in the light of a
bore, rather than as a pleasure, as I once
had done. Occasionally a memory of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>evening when he came to my rescue, as the
hungry, cruel waves gathered like wolves
about me, would flit across my mind, as a
shadow may flit across a sunlit hill. Once
in a long while I found myself dwelling
upon the look he gave me that night, and
this, and the memory of his touch, as he
lifted me off the pier, would dim the sunshine
of my cheerfulness. I could not
have explained this to myself, and I never
dwelt upon the thought; whether from disinclination,
or from fear, I could not tell.
I only knew that I always turned from it
abruptly, and passed on to my plans affecting
my life with Mr. Gregory. It was
quite easy to plan in this direction, for
there was nothing uncertain, as there
might have been in the case of a younger
man. Mr. Gregory was fixed in his tastes,
and way of life; I, too, at my age, had
formed settled habits, and this he knew;
but, fortunately, in most directions, we
were in harmony, and where we were not,
we had fallen into a way of making certain
concessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>So I had matters pretty well laid out;
all my theories, born of years of close observation
of affairs domestic, were now
brought to bear on my own future.
Secretly I esteemed myself a competent
cook, when a husband was the dish under
discussion. Mr. Gregory was not one to
require any very complicated wisdom in
the culinary art. A little gentle stewing;
no strong seasoning; no violent changes or
methods of any sort; but regularity, evenness;
quiet affection; respect; comfort,
and general conformance to taste and nature
would be necessary, and I felt myself
fully equal to it all.</p>

<p>Matters had well-nigh culminated, for I
had received a note from Mr. Gregory asking
when I would be at home to him, and
saying that he had a matter of great moment
to both of us, to lay before me. I set
an evening, and then awaited his coming
without the slightest quickening of my
pulse, but with a serenity and cheerfulness
that appealed to my common sense as the
surest forecast of happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>Just at this juncture, a swift turn of the
wind-cock, or some imprudence of diet,
resulted in my taking cold&mdash;a most unusual
procedure for me, and at the time
of Mr. Gregory&#8217;s call I was unable to see
him, being confined to my bed, in the care
of a doctor, who was fighting a case of
threatened pneumonia.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory expressed his sincere regret,
and the next day called again, and
left flowers. These attentions were repeated
daily, and soon after hearing of my
improvement, he wrote me a letter in
which he said that which he had intended
to say on the evening of the day I fell ill.
He did not request a reply; in fact, he
asked me to withhold my answer until I
should be able to see him in person. It
would have been wiser, perhaps, he said,
to have postponed any word on the subject
until I had recovered, but he had found it
difficult to delay the expression of his feeling
toward me, and hence had written.</p>

<p>This last rather surprised me, for Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Gregory had always seemed so unlikely to
be swayed by impulse, or carried, in the
slightest degree, beyond a point indicated
by his judgment. It simply went to prove
that the most regularly and smoothly laid-out
man, if one may so express it, has unsuspected
crooks and turns.</p>

<p>I had no desire to answer the letter,
being perfectly able and willing to wait
until I should see him. In fact, instead of
hastening the time for my acceptance, I
rather delayed it, for I reached a point in
my convalescence, when I was able to go
down to the parlor, had I so wished, and
still did not.</p>

<p>Each day of my illness, a lovely bouquet
of flowers had been left at my door. They
came direct from the greenhouse, and
were left without card, or sign of the
giver. I had an eccentric little friend who
was quite devoted to me, and was fond of
keeping her left hand in darkest ignorance
of the performances of its counterpart&mdash;the
right hand&mdash;and I attributed this delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>and beautiful token of sympathy and affection
to her; but, for some inexplicable reason,
every morning when the flowers were
brought to my room, and I took them in
my hand, a strange feeling came over me&mdash;a
feeling I had never had toward my
little friend.</p>

<p>Over two weeks had passed, and I was
downstairs in the study. My nurse had
gone out, my housekeeper was busy, and
I was very lonely. I was standing at the
window, looking westward. The sun had
gone down in regal splendor. Some f&ecirc;te
was in progression in the sky, for the attendants
of the god of day were resplendent
in attire. They had been marshalled from
all quarters of the heavens, and their stately
and solemn procession, brilliant with the
most gorgeous red, royal purple, and dazzling
gold, had caused my heart to dilate
with awe and reverential admiration.</p>

<p>The lake, stirred by the wonderful pageant,
caught the many hues as they dropped
from heaven, and tossed them on high in
joyous, iridescent waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>The climax of majesty and beauty was
reached, and then the convocation broke
up&mdash;not suddenly, but slowly, and with
gracious dignity. The sun sank into the
waiting arms of the unknown; the lights
of heaven faded, and the clouds slowly
melted into dusk.</p>

<p>The scene had stirred me as I am seldom
stirred, and with the oncoming of night
new thoughts and feelings rose from their
lair, as strange and beautiful wild animals
step from their caves into the deep mystery
of darkness.</p>

<p>My neighbor next door&mdash;Mrs. Thrush,
sat on her broad, vine-clad gallery, rocking
her little child in her arms. By her
side sat her husband, with one arm thrown
across her lap. He had laid his paper
down, for the daylight was fading, and
perhaps his thought was too happy to
stoop to daily news. Softly the little wife
and mother sang; she had a sweet home
voice, and no music of orchestra ever
moved me as did her lullaby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>I was at that moment an intensely
lonely woman. I thought of Mr. Gregory
and my future, and still I was lonely.</p>

<p>Far away to the east there was a low,
long bank of clouds like a mountain range,
and as the poetry and melody of the lullaby
rose from the little nest on my left,
and stole into my thought, I saw a faint light
above this line; then a group of mist-like
clouds that moved toward me. Slowly the
gray haze, tinged with soft light, began
to resolve itself into shadowy forms, and
my heart stood still as, in some vague
way, I traced a connection between the
lullaby and the vision, and realized that a
message was coming to me.</p>

<p>I was perfectly calm, but with the calmness
which is the outgrowth of an excitement
so tense that it is still. As the vision
floated nearer, I heard soft music&mdash;a crooning,
yearning, soul-satisfying lullaby; I
saw a little child, a mother, and a father.
The child was as beautiful as an angel,
and there was that in its face which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>made my eyes flood with tears, and my
heart ache with yearning; the faces of the
parents were too vague for me to recognize
at first; then slowly, that of the
mother became more distinct, and I saw
<i>myself</i> before me&mdash;myself, a wife and
mother; the visible answer to my heart&#8217;s
deepest, most secret cry. Still the father&#8217;s
face was hidden, but as the vision floated
by, he turned and looked at me&mdash;the vision
wife&mdash;with a look I had seen before, and I
uttered a cry as I recognized <i>Randolph
Chance</i>.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I cried out, I turned slightly and, for
a moment, lost the picture. It was
changed when again I saw it; Randolph
Chance was still there, but he no longer
advanced toward the vision wife&mdash;she had
faded into mist; he came slowly toward
me. There was a beautiful look on his
face&mdash;I cannot describe it&mdash;it was too holy
to translate into language; but I could feel
it vibrate through my being until it set my
very soul a-quivering. I had no power of
resistance&mdash;no wish to resist. I almost
think I went toward him, and he was as
real to me as if he were in the flesh. I
could feel him as he put his arm around
my waist, and his face touched mine. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>vision child had melted away; and we two
were alone; I knew my heart then; I knew
I loved this man.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few moments, but
such moments as make an eternity, for
they wipe out the past, even as death blots
out a life, and they open a door to the
future. Up to that time I had never
thought that, without my knowledge or
intent, my heart could slip from me&mdash;had
never dreamed that I, whose life had always
been most commonplace&mdash;I, who had
had my share of wooing, but had never
felt an extra heart-beat because of it&mdash;no,
never dreamed that I, this <i>I</i>, so practical
and sensible, could be carried off my feet
by a vision. A vision, was it? Yes, and
yet real, too real in some ways, since it revealed
my innermost thought. A vision!
And yet, even now that it had melted into
air, I was clinging to it, and instead of
resenting its startling revelation of self,
was dwelling upon it, and in it, with a delight
beyond words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>I sat there in my study, my head bent,
and my hands loosely clasped in my lap,
living it over and over again. Out of
doors, the soft gray dusk had hushed the
tired world in its arms. Within, the stillness
of night had settled down upon the
room. By and by the moon rose above
the great waters of the lake, and on shore
the trees were casting silent, solemn shadows,
made visible by the soft, hazy light
that lay between them. Once in a while
a bird uttered its night cry, or some little
brooding note, and over on the vine-clad
gallery, Mrs. Thrush still crooned a lullaby
to her little child, who lay asleep&mdash;soft and
warm, on her mother-breast.</p>

<p>I was no longer lonely, no longer shut
out from it all&mdash;there was the bird on its
nest; the little wife and mother in her
home; and I&mdash;I was very near them&mdash;akin
to them. I had seen myself in <i>my</i> home,
with my child, and my husband; I had
felt his dear arms about me, and his dear
face close to mine. I was no longer an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>alien. I, too, had a place in the heart of
another.</p>

<p>Still I sat and dreamed, and even the
ringing of my door-bell failed to rouse me:
but when I heard the maid say to someone:</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been downstairs to-night, but
I think she has gone up now, and I don&#8217;t
like to call her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started forward, saying quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am here&mdash;I will see any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so he came in, but it was not the
one I expected. It was Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>I think that he found my embarrassment
on greeting him both gratifying and encouraging,
but its cause was alien to his
thought. I was brought back from another
world, as it were, with a rude shock,
and in my enfeebled condition, consequent
upon a severe illness could not control myself.
Indeed I did not feel that I was mistress
of myself at any time during the
evening.</p>

<p>After a word or two, which I cannot recall,
I stammered out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;I was not expecting you this evening&mdash;I
had not sent for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you have not,&#8221; he answered&mdash;then
dropping his voice a trifle,
he added, &#8220;I could not wait any longer&mdash;I
found it difficult to wait so long as this. I
hardly dared hope that I might see you
this evening, but I felt I must try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Intent upon sparing him the pain of a
spoken declaration, I exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Gregory, don&#8217;t! please don&#8217;t
say anything more. I am not deserving
of your esteem and kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came nearer me, and his voice was
at once tender and reverent, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more than worthy of what I
have to offer, which is myself, and all that
I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; I cried again; &#8220;don&#8217;t say anything
more! Let us imagine this unsaid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such words can never be recalled,&#8221; he
said gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be,&#8221; I persisted; &#8220;I cannot
accept! I have nothing to give in return!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>A look of disappointment came over his
face, and if I mistake not, it was shaded
with displeasure. &#8220;I hardly expected
this, Miss Leigh, I have hardly been led to
expect this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, Mr. Gregory,&#8221;
I replied, more calmly than I had spoken
before; &#8220;I know that I have accepted your
attentions&mdash;you have had every reason to
expect a different answer. I&#8217;ll not try to
deceive you, or keep anything from
you. I&#8217;ll tell you that I have not been
trifling. I have understood you for some
time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted me here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you must have done so; my attentions
to you could have but one interpretation,
if I were a man of honor, and
you knew I was that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, indeed,&#8221; I exclaimed. And
then my mind went, with a flash like
lightning, to Randolph Chance, and I felt
a sudden resentment. Had not he shown
me attentions that no man of honor can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>bestow upon a woman, unless he wishes to
make her his wife? Why had he left me
in this strait? Why had he not spoken
out? Why had he not claimed before the
world that which he had taken such pains
to win? I was uncertain about Randolph
Chance; I had never been uncertain about
Mr. Gregory. Why? Because I had perfect
confidence in his honor. Was he not
the better man&mdash;the more trustworthy?
Why could I not marry him? I loved another
man. A wave of shame and anger
swept my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have all along been expecting to
marry you. I have not been trifling,&#8221; I
cried out.</p>

<p>He stepped forward, and took my hand.
It was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it then, Constance, that has
changed you? Have I done anything
since your illness to make you think less
of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I trembled from head to foot, and my
lips were so stiff and dry that they scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>would do my bidding. I must have
spoken very indistinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no,&#8221; I said slowly; &#8220;I will tell
you everything&mdash;I have done you a wrong,
an unintentional wrong, but I will do penance&mdash;I
have seen myself to-night&mdash;&#8221; I
paused here; Mr. Gregory was a practical
man; had I told him that a vision had
changed my attitude, he would have
thought me insane. I myself had begun
to entertain doubts as to my sanity. &#8220;I
know myself now,&#8221; I faltered, &#8220;I know
my heart&mdash;I love another man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory rose, and began pacing the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This surprises me greatly,&#8221; he said at
length; &#8220;there must have been another
courtship&mdash;it would seem that you must
have known something of how matters
were tending.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have known nothing until to-night.
There has been no courtship, in the ordinary
acceptation of that word&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you
all, even if it humbles me completely, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>penalty for what I have done to you. The
man I love&mdash;&#8221; I could feel the blood mantling
my face and neck, &#8220;has never addressed
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory paused, and looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is extraordinary,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;I know it is&mdash;it is most of all so
to me, for it is wholly unlike what I have
been all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us not talk of this any more to-night,
Miss Leigh,&#8221; he said, with evident
relief; &#8220;I have been wrong to press this
matter now, when you are hardly recovered.
You are not yourself. This is
something transitory, no doubt. Later on,
you may feel differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; I exclaimed eagerly, &#8220;now
that we have begun, let us say it all.
Don&#8217;t&mdash;I beg of you, don&#8217;t go away with
a feeling that I don&#8217;t know my mind. I
am weak and miserable to-night&mdash;&#8221; here
the tears choked my voice, and I all but
broke down, &#8220;but I am miserable because
I have learned my true feeling, and know
that I must disappoint&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>I could not go on, and again he sat down
beside me and took my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand you,&#8221; he said
simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand myself,&#8221; I replied;
&#8220;but all this is none the less real for that.
I have learned of it to-night, but it has existed
before; it explains many things in
the past year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is the case, then I must accept
your decision as final.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; I answered briefly.</p>

<p>He rose, and walked the room in silence
again; then pausing once more, he said
calmly, and with no trace of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the disappointment of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said nothing. What could I say? To
utter any platitudes about being sorry,
would have been to insult him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man cannot live to my age&mdash;I am
fifty-two, Miss Leigh&mdash;without experiencing
disappointment, but I have known
nothing equal to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paced the room a few moments, and
then said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;This interview must be distressing to
you. I am very sorry I brought it about
before you were strong and well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say one thing before you go, Mr.
Gregory,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;only say that you
don&#8217;t think I have willfully misled you&mdash;say
that you respect me still.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face was stirred by a slight quiver,
as a placid lake is stirred by an impulse of
the evening air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had, and you always will
have my deepest respect, and my deepest
affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took my hand silently, and then
quietly left the room.</p>

<p>And I sat there until I heard the front
door close. Then I went upstairs, but I
remember nothing after reaching the first
landing.</p>

<p>They found me lying there. They said
I must have fainted.</p>

<a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> badly upset for several days.
For a time I resolutely put all thought
of what had occurred from my mind,
but as soon as I felt able, I sat down, with
the whole matter before me, as it were,
and deliberately looked it in the face. I
think I never felt more inane in my life
than when I remembered my folly, as I
now regarded it. All that saved me from
utter self-abasement was the fact that it
had occurred at a time when I was at such
a low ebb physically, by reason of illness.
I determined to try to forget it, as speedily
as possible. But, however keenly I felt
the humiliation and folly of my emotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>upon that strange night, it never occurred
to me to waver, when recalling my decision
to bring matters between Mr. Gregory
and myself to an end. My refusal of him
had been brought about by one cause, and
only one&mdash;that I fully realized; and now
that I had repudiated the cause, I might
have been expected to reconsider the refusal.
But I did not.</p>

<p>Soon after I was up and about once
more, I learned that my little friend had
not sent the flowers. I thought&mdash;no, I did
not think! but I cherished secretly a&mdash;well,
no! I cherished <i>nothing</i> in secret or
in public!</p>

<p>I learned something else, soon after getting
up, and this was that a story was going
the rounds to the effect that Mr. Gregory
had broken our engagement&mdash;and my
disappointment had well-nigh occasioned
me a relapse. But in a twinkling, almost
before I had time to get indignant, Mrs.
Catlin was running about, telling everybody
that Mr. Gregory had confided in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>her, in strictest confidence, the truth of
the matter, which was that I had ended
the affair, and not he.</p>

<p>I was much moved by this manly act
on Mr. Gregory&#8217;s part. He showed his
shrewdness, too; he could not announce
this in public, or go to people one by one,
so he confided it to Mrs. Catlin, and told
her not to tell.</p>

<p>One Sabbath evening about ten
o&#8217;clock, I began to lock up the house.
Early retirement is something all but unknown
to me, but that night, having no
particular reason for sitting up, I was
about to indulge in it as a novelty.</p>

<p>I raised the shade of one of the study
windows, with intent to draw the bolt, but
my hand paused in the act, for my eyes
were captured by a scene of surpassing
beauty. Fall had lately swept her gorgeous
leaves one side, and closed her doors
for the season, and we were now standing
on the threshold of winter. The early
snows are apt to be soft and clinging; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>later on, usually, when the thermometer
takes a plunge downward, that they become
crisp and hard. It is seldom, however,
at any time of year that the atmospheric
conditions are favorable to such a
creation as I beheld that night. I hardly
know just what is necessary to make it all&mdash;a
still, moderate cold, and a very humid
air are among the most important conditions,
I believe.</p>

<p>When I stepped outside my door early
in the evening, the air all about me
seemed to be snow, not separated into
flakes, but diffused evenly. Altogether it
had the effect of a heavy white fog, and I
could see even then, that it was settling in
visible, palpable, feathery forms, not only
upon the ground, but upon every bush and
tree as well. It was a most unusual scene,
and I gazed at it long and admiringly; but
having no fondness for walking through
soft, clinging snow, I was not enticed to
sally forth, as I always am when the
snow is firm and sparkling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>But by ten o&#8217;clock the temperature had
changed, and in the cooler air the almost
imperceptible melting of the snow had
been stayed.</p>

<p>The white carpet that had slowly been
sinking, was now stationary, and was covered
by a firm crust that gleamed in the
moonlight. There was no sparkle on the
trees, but the feathery tufts and pinions
had ceased floating to the ground, and
melting into air. The scene, in all its
matchless beauty, was arrested&mdash;held upon
nature&#8217;s canvas for a few hours, by the
Master hand.</p>

<p>Stay in doors that night! Would I be
so wicked as to turn my back, or close my
eyes upon one of the most delectable scenes
that ever a kind Providence spread before
the soul of human creature! Would I
deliberately slight such an exhibition of
love and marvelous skill? Not I!</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t take me long to catch up hat
and jacket, and with a heart that beat
high, slip from my house, as a greyhound
slips the leash, and hie me away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>What mattered it that the neighborhood
lights were raised&mdash;a story, at least&mdash;and
that the owners of all the villas near at
hand, were preparing for decorous, temporary
retirement. I merely pitied them
for their stupidity, and went my way. I
had long been a law unto myself, and
while I did not believe in flaunting my independence
in their faces, I none the less
continued to enjoy it.</p>

<p>There are nights when to sleep would be
the sin of an ingrate; &#8217;twould be like gathering
up the good things of Providence,
and hurling them from out the window, in
reckless waste. And this night was such
a one.</p>

<p>The keen air, and the entrancing beauty
about me, seemed to run in a subtle, fascinating
torrent through my veins, and
lend me wings. I felt as though I were
buoyed up by magic hands; I hardly
think I set foot on ground the whole way,
and yet I must, for I was conscious of a
crisp crackle of the snow at every step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Oh, is there any sound just like it! Could
our poor invalids but pitch their nostrums
over the wall, and take this tonic instead!</p>

<p>Some friends of mine moved a while
ago and drove their family stake in a
spot far off from here. They are continually
writing me of a region of perpetual
sunshine and summer. I thought
of them on this glorious night, and pitied
them from the depths of my heart, as I
often have, indeed, since they went
out there. Theirs is the place for the extremely
indigent, no doubt, but for any
one who can command a dollar or so for
fuel, this&mdash;this is the land of delight.</p>

<p>I was at no loss as to direction; our
suburb was beautiful throughout, especially
all along by the lake, but there was
one place in particular, where art and nature
had joined hands, with a result indescribable.
Toward these grounds I hastened,
on this particular night.</p>

<p>Oh, the glory of that moon! the glory of
the lake! an undulating sea of waves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>each crested with a feather, as soft, as
snowy in the moonlight, as the tinier ones
that hung upon the trees.</p>

<p>I ran down the winding avenue&mdash;the
white fog still lingered in the deep places,
but above, all was clear and glorious.
Erelong I entered the Dunham&#8217;s grounds.
At a certain point, unmarked to the
stranger&#8217;s eye, a rustic flight of stairs, now
strewn with dead leaves&mdash;padded with
snow as well, to-night, dips down from
the broad driveway. Quickly I made my
way by this path, and erelong, stood
upon one of the little rustic bridges spanning
the ravine, and connecting with a
similar flight of ascending stairs upon the
other side. There I paused, and well I
might. It were a dull, plodding creature
indeed, who would not be spellbound by
such a scene! On either hand were the
sloping wooded sides of the ravine whose
depths were shrouded in the mysterious
whiteness of the fog; above me, a short
distance in front, was the arch of the broad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>picturesque bridge with which the driveway
spans the hollow. The little rustic
bridge on which I stood was much lower
than the larger one; hence, from my position,
I looked through the archway, beyond,
down, and far along the ravine. Can
you call up fairyland to your mental eye? It
would pale before this scene&mdash;those feathery
trees! that enchanting vista! I stood
there drinking it in, and pitying the sleeping
world. I could not, even in thought,
express my delight and gratitude for being
permitted to behold such beauty, but
finally a familiar line leaped from my lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Praise God from whom all blessings flow.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I can never forget that night; it kindled
and warmed my heart with a reverential
fire. If, in the course of years, my way
should be overcast; if, for a time, I should
let the artificial&mdash;the ignoble, clog the path,
and shut me out from the light of heaven,
even then I shall be saved from doubt,
which is always engendered by our stupidity&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>things of our own manufacture&mdash;I
shall be saved from doubt by the sweet,
pure, radiant memory of that winter,
moonlight scene. Only a beneficent God
could create such beauty.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my way back&mdash;at what dissipated
hour I firmly decline to state&mdash;I passed a
home with an interesting history tacked
thereto.</p>

<p>The leading events were brought me by
one of those active, inquisitive little birds
that find out all sorts of things, and often
fetch from great distances.</p>

<p>The couple who live there, though
Americans, once lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
and it was in that place that the husband
fell to drinking. The little bird
above alluded to&mdash;the bird that acts as a
kind of domestic ferret&mdash;told me that, in
the early years of their married life, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>wife was of an excitable, hysterical temperament,
and given to making scenes.
Just here let me digress a moment to erect
a warning signboard. I have a friend
who is busy mixing and administering a
deadly draught to her domestic happiness,
and yet does not know it. She has only
been married a year, and she uses tears
and scenes, in general, as instruments to
pull from her husband the attention, affection,
and devotion she craves. The tug
waxes increasingly hard, but she has not,
as yet, sense enough to see that, and desist.
She cannot realize that the success
attained by such methods is but the temporary
and external beauty, which, in
reality, covers a failure of the most hopeless
type, just as the flush on the consumptive&#8217;s
cheek is but a pitiable counterfeit,
and covers a fatal disease.</p>

<p>Whether in this particular story, the
report of the wife&#8217;s early blunders be true
or false, there seems to be no doubt that
presently the husband grew careless and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>indifferent; that scene followed scene between
them, until at last he went to drinking.
Then the little wife waxed sober,
thoughtful, and studied much within herself.
This awful sorrow, following so
closely upon the heels of her wedding-day
joy, matured her judgment&mdash;her womanhood,
and she began to use every skillful
device to call back her husband from the
dark paths he had chosen, to the light.
All in vain, however; and when she realized
this, after several years of heroic
effort, she made one last scene, and told
him she was going to leave him. Then
his old-time tenderness returned&mdash;if you
can compare a tenderness which was
blurred and cringing, with that which was
clear and manly. He begged and promised
in vain, however, for she had lost faith,
and a lost faith is not found again for
many a day.</p>

<p>So she went off, and she covered all
traces and signs so carefully that no anxious,
heartbroken effort of his could find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>her. Meanwhile she wrote him frequently
and regularly, and although he knew not
where to send reply, it is quite likely she
had word of him from some one to whom
she had given her confidence in this dreary
time.</p>

<p>And so five years passed, and at their
close she walked into her home one day,
and her husband&mdash;a man once more, took
her in his arms, and looked his love and
joy with clear, honest eyes.</p>

<p>They came to our city, or rather this
little suburb of our city, soon afterward,
and although it is well-nigh ten years now
that they have been among us, there has
never been a hint of trouble. Hers was a
unique method, but it brought about the
desired end.</p>

<p>Verily it would seem that for some dinners,
it is best for the cook to vanish, and
leave the dishes to get themselves.</p>

<p>I was meditating on this as I walked
home that night, and the next morning,
stirred by the recollection of all I had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>and felt, was moved to write out a story
given me by a young man&mdash;a friend of
mine, who lives at a great distance from
here, on an olive ranch out of Los Gatos,
California.</p>

<p>I wish I could give you this little tale
just as he told it. I can&#8217;t, I know, but I&#8217;ll
do my best in trying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purblind dropped in just as I was
reading it over to myself, before my study
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember my story about
Duke?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I liked it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;though I&#8217;m
not very partial to dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one here about horses. I&#8217;ve
written it out as nearly as possible as my
friend told it to me, but so much flavor is
lost when these things change hands.
Here it is, and I think that the lamentation
David sang over Saul, might head it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A while ago we owned a couple of
horses&mdash;work horses, and yet, by reason
of the strength of their affections, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>were lifted from out the commonplace,
and enveloped with an atmosphere of romance
that gave them the flavor of a story
book, plumb full of princes and heroes.
And by the way, Prince was the name of
one of them, and he was a genuine hero,
as you will see. His mate was called
Nelly, and albeit she was as awkward and
as angular as the ideal old maid, vastly
inferior to Prince, who was a fine-looking
chap, yet his admiration for her was unbounded.
She cared for him, I&#8217;m sure, but
she was less demonstrative; more coquettish,
I would say, if she hadn&#8217;t been too
homely a beast to think of, in connection
with such a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were brought up together; were
taught by the same master; sat on the
same bench, in a figurative sense; were
lovers from the very first. Prince certainly
had the most elegant manners;
Nelly was his first thought, at all times,
and his courtesy to her savored of the old
school. He wouldn&#8217;t go into the shed of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>cold, rainy day and leave Nelly outside;
but if she went in, he was more than content
to follow. When it was necessary to
separate them&mdash;we couldn&#8217;t always work
them together&mdash;we had to tie Prince with
ropes and cables, as it were, to hold him
fast. Nelly was less difficult to manage;
at least, she would let him go out of sight
without fretting, and yet, after all, she
seemed easier if he were at hand. I remember,
one day, he was tied in front of
the house, and she was loose, grazing near
by. As long as he could see her, all went
well enough, but the moment she sauntered
around the fence, he began first to
fidget, then to paw and neigh, and finally
to struggle, until in the end, he broke loose
and rushed after his inamorata. And what
a time he made over her! whinnying, and
demonstrating his delight in a dozen different
ways. She? oh, she took it coolly, but
that was all feminine bosh, or coquetry on
her part. She liked to have him near her
well enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&#8220;There was an amusing thing happened
one day, down in the field. Father and I
were plowing with Nell. We had tied
Prince to a tree, the other side of the knoll
we were working on, and supposed he
was fast, but to our surprise, just as we
turned, after finishing a long furrow, we
confronted the gentleman, tree and all,
standing before us in a weak and fainting
condition. He had struggled until he had
uprooted the whole business, and was so
used up in consequence, that he could
hardly stagger, much less go into his usual
hysterics over Nell. She looked as amazed
as we did, and I&#8217;ve no doubt gave him a
sound curtain lecture on his folly that
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day father and Ned took Prince
down into the field. Steve and I stayed
up near the house, working around the
vineyard. Nelly was in the stable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning was half gone, when all
at once Steve happened to turn around,
and look down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Gosh, Jack!&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;the barn&#8217;s
afire.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave one startled look, and then ran
for the hose.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Get Nelly out!&#8217; I cried to Steve; but
after a second look, I called, &#8216;No, don&#8217;t
you do it! Let her go! it&#8217;s too late!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I won&#8217;t let her go!&#8217; he shouted; &#8216;do
you think I&#8217;ll stand by and see Nelly
burned to death!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;d be a fool to go in now! Look
at that stable! Here! Stand back! Have
you lost your wits?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me go!&#8217; he cried; &#8216;Jack, get out
of the way!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I threw him down and held him. I
was bigger than he; older, and cooler-headed
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There, I give in,&#8217; he said in a moment; &#8216;it&#8217;s
wicked to lose time this way.
Let me up, Jack, and we&#8217;ll get the hose.
I promise you I won&#8217;t go in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ran for the hose, and turned on all
the water we could command, and by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>time mother and the servant girl had
come from the house, and were helping
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could hear Nelly struggling in her
stall, and I tell you it made us sick! Unluckily
we had chained her, in anticipation
of her trying to get loose, and go after
Prince. She&#8217;d never been left at home
this way before, and we&#8217;d taken extra
pains to secure her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stable doors were fastened by a
heavy bolt; again and again I tried to
push it back, but it was so fiery hot I
couldn&#8217;t touch it, and when I tried to hammer
it, the flames drove me off.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing for it but to leave
poor Nelly to her fate. It seemed as if she
divined our intent, for, as we turned away,
she uttered a piercing scream. Mother
burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t stand it,&#8217; she said, covering
her ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again and again Nelly&#8217;s voice rang out.
Steve stood there, his face drawn and
white. All at once he took out his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s twelve o&#8217;clock!&#8217; he cried; &#8216;father&#8217;ll
be home in a moment, and if Prince hears
Nelly he&#8217;ll go mad. Head &#8217;em off, Jack!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t wait for another word, but ran
with all my might down the road by
which they always came.</p>

<p>&#8220;As fate would have it, they had chosen
the other one that day, and were well
along, before I caught sight of them.
Father had taken Prince out of the plow,
and harnessed him to a little single-seated
gig we had. He was driving him, and
Ned was walking behind. I saw Steve
running toward them, but he was still at
a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Father,&#8217; I yelled at the top of my
voice, &#8216;stop! father! the stable&#8217;s on fire.
Turn Prince back. Nelly is burning!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father didn&#8217;t seem to understand, for
although he listened, he kept driving
slowly on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouted again, running toward them,
and gesticulating frantically. All at once
Ned caught my meaning, and bounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>like a deer in front of the gig, grabbed
Prince by the head to turn him, but at
that very moment a terrible scream from
poor Nelly split our ears, and in less time
than it takes to tell there was a maddened
horse plunging in midair, with four strong
men clinging to him, trying to hold him
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let him go, boys! Let him go!&#8217;
shouted father; &#8216;it&#8217;s no use! Let him go,
I tell you! He&#8217;ll kill us all!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, God! I can&#8217;t let the old fellow
burn up!&#8217; sobbed Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Prince had begun to lay about him
with his teeth, and father knocked Steve
down to get him out of the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe we all sobbed, as we watched
the old hero go up that hill and into the
stable; Nelly was quiet now, and the doors
were down.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard him groan once or twice, and
then mother came to meet us, and took us
all into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out yonder&mdash;the monument we
put up. It&#8217;s over both of them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;Well, what has that horse story to do
with men?&#8221; asked a sneering voice, when I
had finished my little tale, and Mrs. Purblind
and I were sitting silent.</p>

<p>I turned, and to my astonishment and
disgust saw Mrs. Cynic, who had come in
quietly, unobserved by me, as I was reading.</p>

<p>I should not have answered her a word,
but Mrs. Purblind thought to avert an
awkward situation, so she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It illustrates the devotion of the masculine
nature, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In horses? Yes; it&#8217;s a pity that it
hasn&#8217;t been evoluted into men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has,&#8221; I answered curtly, &#8220;for those
who are capable of seeing and appreciating
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This probably made her angry, for she
turned on me with her most evil expression:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery to me why, with your
overweening admiration for the other sex,
you haven&#8217;t married, Miss Leigh. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>must have had countless opportunities;
child-like faith, such as yours, must be
very attractive to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared at her a moment in silence; her
insolence stupefied me. Then I think I
opened the nearest window, and pitched
her out. Mrs. Purblind insists I did not
do that, exactly, but that I got rid of her.
As she hasn&#8217;t been in since, a desirable
result was obtained, and I don&#8217;t much care
what the method may have been.</p>

<p>I aired my house the rest of the day,
having a wish to cleanse it, and protect
my moral nature, much as one would rid
a place of sewer gas, to protect the physical
being.</p>

<p>I was not in a very good temper after
all this, and it annoyed me to see Randolph
Chance coming in before taking his
train. He had been calling oftener than
usual of late, but he didn&#8217;t seem to have
much to say, and so his coming gave no
especial pleasure.</p>

<p>To-day what talk we had ran on flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>for a time, when Mr. Chance, awkwardly
and out-of-placedly, asked me how I liked
the <i>Reve d&#8217;or</i> rose. This was the kind of
rose I had received every morning, during
my illness.</p>

<p>I looked at him inquiringly. I confess
my heart was beating faster.</p>

<p>He flushed, and said abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have known I sent you
those.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; I answered rather coldly;
&#8220;there was no card or note with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d know,&#8221; he said with
increasing embarrassment; and then he
added, almost desperately, &#8220;you must
know, Constance, that I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing,&#8221; I replied, drawing
myself up haughtily; &#8220;I take nothing of
this kind for granted. If you want me to
understand, you must come out openly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done enough, surely,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;enough to lead you to guess the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess nothing of this sort!&#8221; I reiterated;
&#8220;what right have you to place me in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>this position? What right have you, or
any other man to deprive a woman of one
of her dearest privileges&mdash;that of being
wooed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Constance!&#8221; he cried, and all his embarrassment
was gone, &#8220;aren&#8217;t there a
thousand ways of saying &#8216;I love you?&#8217; and
haven&#8217;t I said it in every way but one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That one was the most important of
all,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;I would have given
more to hear those words than to receive
every other token.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face lighted up with a sudden flash,
and he started impulsively toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you <i>do</i> love me, my darling&mdash;I
have hardly dared to hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I drew back, and answered passionately,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not! I love no man who can
trifle with a young girl, or any woman&mdash;no
man who has the effrontery to expect
some one to take for granted a courtship
that has never existed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, what <i>do</i> you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;Go to Miss Sprig and inquire; she has
more reason to take your love for granted
than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not go to her, but I shall leave
you,&#8221; he said, with a white face. &#8220;You
certainly don&#8217;t care for me, or you would
never deal me such an unjust thrust as
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I heard him close the front
door. I think the neighborhood heard
him.</p>

<p>I walked to the window. He was gone.</p>

<p>I told myself I was glad of it&mdash;that a
good lesson had been taught.</p>

<p>Which of us was teacher remained
somewhat obscure.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might reasonably be supposed that
the event last narrated disturbed my life.
It did in a measure, and for a time, but I
was not very long in bringing it back to its
accustomed channel.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, although we
lived across the street from one another, I
saw nothing of Mr. Chance for many
weeks. Perhaps it is not strange though,
after all, since each of us was taking
pains to avoid the other, and we knew
each other&#8217;s habits of life pretty well by
this time.</p>

<p>But if I didn&#8217;t see him, I heard of him
frequently enough, for Mrs. Purblind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>rarely ever met me without saying something
about &#8220;Dolph,&#8221; as she called him.
She was exceedingly fond of him, and
with good cause, for he was a most affectionate,
thoughtful, unselfish brother. He
was very different from her, and they
were not confidential friends, when serious
matters were concerned, but they were
companionable, nevertheless.</p>

<p>It is not likely Mrs. Purblind realized
that she was shut out from something that
deeply concerned her brother; but she
worried about him. She was certain he
was ill&mdash;he had little appetite, and was in
no way like himself, she said. Miss Sprig
wondered what had come over him.</p>

<p>I believe Mrs. Purblind must have been
deaf as well as blind, otherwise the neighborhood
gossip regarding Mr. Chance and
myself, which was rife a year ago, would
certainly have reached her. Evidently she
had heard nothing, and she continued to
keep my innermost breast in a secret ferment,
by pouring her fears and speculations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>into my ear. She even confided in
me that she had for a long time suspected
the existence of an affair between Miss
Sprig and her brother, but this young
woman declared that he never paid her the
slightest attention of a matrimonial character;
that he&#8217;d been very kind to her,
very jolly, and friendly, but that was all.</p>

<p>I think that if Mount Vesuvius had
leaped out of me, and taken its departure,
I could scarce have felt more relieved. I
really had been harboring a volcano for
some time, and it was a hot tenant.</p>

<p>Shortly after hearing this latter piece of
Mrs. Purblind&#8217;s news, another bit was
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph has gone away,&#8221; she said, one
day; &#8220;left suddenly, this morning. He
confessed to being played out, and I&#8217;m
sure he looks it. He&#8217;s gone on to Buffalo,
to brother Dave&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night I sat down and wrote a letter;
when one has done wrong, his first
conscious act should be to confess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>I was in a trying position; one is at such
a time. Two months had elapsed, and
Mr. Chance might have changed his mind
and intent. Men do, occasionally; women,
too. And indeed he never had asked me
to marry him. True, that is the supposition
when a man, with any real manhood
about him, tells a woman he loves her&mdash;when
he shows her marked attentions, in
fact; but, as I said to Mr. Chance, I did not
intend to take such things for granted. I
had not changed in that respect. I had,
however, become convinced that I was
harsh and unjust to him. It is a blundering
teacher who takes badness in a child
for granted&mdash;does not wait for proof. It
is an inspired teacher who ignores the bad
sometimes, even after it has been proven.
To think the worst, so some of the psychologists
tell us, will often create the worst.
Even a cook does well to make the most
of her materials. Her dishes will be likely
to turn out ill, if she treats the ingredients
with disrespect. It would seem that I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>who had in a manner made a specialty of
matrimonial cookery, had something yet
to learn. Randolph Chance had given me
a lesson.</p>

<p>In my letter, I said that time and
thought had shown me I had done him a
wrong, and that I was very sorry; that,
no doubt, he had changed in some feelings,
and it was, perhaps, not likely we should
meet very soon; but that I wished him to
know I realized my mistake, and that I
was still his friend.</p>

<p>The second day after I had written, I
heard from him; our letters were penned
the same night, and must have crossed
each other. In his he said he had held off
as long as he could, but was coming right
back from Buffalo to see me. He was
certain he could explain everything; he had
nothing to hide, and he hoped I would let
him tell me what was in his heart; that
for months he had known but one real
wish, one real aspiration&mdash;to win me for
his wife. He begged me to let him begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>anew, and make an effort to attain this
great end.</p>

<p>That evening, in the gloaming, I was at
my study window. I could look into the
parlor of the Thrush home. A shadow
had fallen upon that dear nest; one of the
little birdies had flown away, but it was
now forever sheltered from all storms in
the dear Christ&#8217;s bosom, so all was well.
The gentle little mother was nearly crushed
at first, even more so than the father,
though he felt the loss deeply; but erelong
she lifted her sweet face, and smiled
through her tears. And now, at the end
of two weeks, she was to her husband, at
least, as cheerful as ever, even more tender,
and she made the home as bright as
before. So many women are selfish in
their grief, unwise too. They act as if
their husbands were aliens, and did not
share the sorrow. It is true the man usually
recovers sooner than the woman
from such a blow, but no one should blame
him for that. His nature is different, necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>different; not in kind, but in degree.
It has to be; his is the outside battle;
he must needs be rugged. But &#8220;a
man&#8217;s a man for a&#8217; that,&#8221; and the woman
who shuts him out in the hour of bereavement,
or who darkens the home continuously,
and overcasts its good cheer, is both
selfish and foolish. In such cases husband
and wife are parted, instead of being
brought nearer to one another, as they
should be when they have a little ambassador
in the court of Heaven.</p>

<p>My heart was very tender that evening,
and as I sat beside the glowing fire, before
the lamps were lighted, my thoughts ran
to Mrs. Purblind. The poor little woman
had seemed sad of late, and I guessed,
without word from her, that it was because
her husband was going out so much
at night. I did wish she could see some
things as they really were.</p>

<p>She sat there with me that evening&mdash;in
spirit, at least, on the opposite side of the
fireplace, and her mournful face touched
me deeply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to care for his home,&#8221;
she said sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him care for it. Man is a
domestic animal. If he doesn&#8217;t stay at
home, something is wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do all I can,&#8221; she answered in a dull
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you do now,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but
learn more, and then you will improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking over some trunks in the
attic to-day, and I came across my wedding
gown. It called up so much! I
can&#8217;t get over it&mdash;&#8221; and she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t speak just then. The tears
were too near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, when first I wore that gown, how
happy I was, and how I looked forward to
the future! Everything was bright then,
but now it&#8217;s so changed that I&#8217;d hardly
know it was the same&mdash;it isn&#8217;t the same&mdash;I&#8217;m
not the same, either&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she broke down again.</p>

<p>I leaned over, and laid my hand on hers.
You know she wasn&#8217;t really there; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>real Mrs. Purblind seldom talked over her
affairs with me, but I could feel what she
was suffering, none the less.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to tell you something, if I
may,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>She assented in a dumb sort of fashion,
and I leaned a little nearer.</p>

<p>The firelight gleamed on the walls, and
in its glow the pictures looked down
kindly upon us. Soft shadows rested in
the corners of the room, and an air of
peace and comfort brooded throughout, as
a bird upon her nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think a little while,&#8221; I said gently;
&#8220;think of his side. Is he quite the same
as he was when he married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;he was so
loving and attentive then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had he any hopes and plans? Enthusiasm?
Did life look bright to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>A serious look traversed her face, as
though she were entertaining a new
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at him as he used to be,&#8221; I continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>And as I spoke, she saw that a young
man with a fresh, sunny face&mdash;a healthy,
happy, care-free face&mdash;was sitting in the
ruddy firelight.</p>

<p>She gave a start.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Joe as he used to be!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Oh, how he&#8217;s changed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, the young man
faded away, and an older man&mdash;much
older, apparently, careworn, and unhappy-looking&mdash;took
his place.</p>

<p>The coals in the glowing grate sank,
and the bright light suddenly died. A
deep shadow rested upon the figure beside
us; he was with us, and yet seemed so
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would think a man could change
that way in ten years!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Purblind; &#8220;would you believe it possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless he had known many disappointments,
and borne loads and cares
beyond his years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never thought
of that,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I believe poor
Joe has been disappointed too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>&#8220;He certainly has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, and there&#8217;s no help for it
now,&#8221; she added with a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; I urged, laying my
hand on hers again; &#8220;you close the gate of
heaven when you say &#8216;no hope.&#8217; There is
always hope as long as there is a spark of
life&mdash;any physician will tell you that. If
you can be patient&mdash;be strong to bear, and
wait&mdash;if you can make home bright, and
not care, or not seem to care if he slights
it and you, for weeks&mdash;months, maybe
years&mdash;it takes so much longer to undo,
than to do&mdash;there is <i>every</i> hope. He
couldn&#8217;t do this, but a woman&mdash;a real
woman, is strong enough, with God on
her side.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dullness left her face, and an unselfish
light dawned in its place. As she rose
to go, she leaned over the other figure,
and he looked up at her, with something
of the old-time love.</p>

<p>I replenished the fire after they had gone&mdash;they
went out together&mdash;and as I sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>there thinking of it all, I heard a sudden
rushing sound in the street.</p>

<p>I ran to the door, just in time to see a
farm wagon, drawn by two strong horses,
go pell-mell past my house, and overturn,
as the frightened animals dashed around
the corner. The neighborhood was agog
in a moment, and I joined the rest in trying
to help the occupants of the broken
vehicle. We brought them into the house&mdash;the
man and woman and a little
child.</p>

<p>As soon as they were in the light, I
knew them; they were some of my people&mdash;a
German family, by the name of Abraham,
who lived on a little farm just outside
our suburb. They had been to me
typical representatives of a stupid class, who
have all the hardships of life, and none of
its soft lights and shades. They were the
kind that plant their pig-sty on the lake
side of their house&mdash;put the pig-sty betwixt
them and every other beauty, it seemed to
me. What can life hold for such people?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>They know nothing of love, or any other
joy. Merely an animal existence is theirs.</p>

<p>We fetched a doctor as speedily as possible&mdash;the
parents were merely bruised,
but the little child was badly hurt. At
first we feared she was dying, and it was
a relief to be told that she would probably
live.</p>

<p>I went out of the room to get some bandages,
and the doctor followed me. Returning
suddenly, I ran upon an unexpected
scene; up to that time, before us
all, the parents had seemed perfectly stolid;
but just as I opened the door, the wife and
mother rose from her knees by the bed,
and I have seldom seen a look more expressive
of tender love than that with
which her husband took her in his arms.</p>

<p>We have many things to learn in the
next world; one of these, I am sure, will
be, not to judge by the life upon the surface.
There is a deep fount of feeling beneath,
and often it is those whom we least
suspect, who dip down into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>I was still busy with these people, when
Randolph Chance walked in upon me.
His kind heart needed no prompting to
join in our little attentions, and he was of
especial use in getting a vehicle to take the
family home.</p>

<p>After they had gone, and we found ourselves
alone, a great embarrassment seemed
to seize him in a fatal grasp.</p>

<p>By and by I realized that I was really
getting incensed, and I was afraid I should
soon be in the position of the man who
went to another, whom he had ill-treated,
to apologize for his bad conduct, and, &#8220;By
Jove, sir&#8221;&mdash;to use his own phrase, &#8220;I hit
him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to keep my letter before my eyes.
I didn&#8217;t want to be forced by that inexorable
tyrant&mdash;conscience&mdash;to write another.
And I should, if I didn&#8217;t hold on to myself,
and this man didn&#8217;t behave differently.</p>

<p>To avoid a clash, I set to work to clear
away some of the confusion consequent
upon the accident, and he helped me in
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>One would suppose that might serve to
cool him, and it did indeed, to such an extent
that, upon our settling down again, he
began the most commonplace conversation,
giving me some incidents of his trip;
discussing the scenery; weather; population,
and general aspects of Buffalo; with
much more of the dryest, most disagreeable
stuff, that a man ever had the temerity to
use, as a means of wasting a woman&#8217;s
evening.</p>

<p>To employ a childish phrase&mdash;it best fits
the occasion&mdash;I grew madder and madder,
until at last matters within me rose to
such a height, that when he began to tell
of his brother&#8217;s house in Buffalo, and to
dwell upon the peculiarities of its furniture,
I felt peculiar enough to hurl all of mine at
him.</p>

<p>The number of things I thought of that
evening would form a library of energetic
literature. Among other resolves, I determined
from that day on, if I lived till my
hair whitened&mdash;lived till I raised my third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>or fourth crop of teeth, never, <i>never</i>, to give
Randolph Chance another thought. There
was one comfort: he did not know, nor did
any one else, what a complete goose I had
made of myself; but, though I <i>had</i> been
most foolish, thanks to a sober, Puritanic
ancestry, I still had myself in hand; my
hysterics had been occasional and secluded,
and I was not wholly gone daft. I could
recover; I would! and then, if ever he
came to my feet, he would learn that some
things don&#8217;t rise, after once they are cold.</p>

<p>I was calm enough when he at last decided
to go, and instead of running on excitedly,
as I had been vaguely conscious of
doing part of the evening, I really conversed.
Indeed, to speak modestly, I
think I was rather interesting. I had
forgotten what he had called for. So had
he&mdash;apparently.</p>

<p>All I hoped was that he did not intend
to bore me with frequent repetitions of this
call. I had better use for my evenings
than such waste of time as chatting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>him. I cast about me for some suitable
excuse to shut off future inflictions, and at
last hit upon one that I thought might
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must sacrifice myself for a
while,&#8221; I said cheerfully; &#8220;I have had a
deal of business swoop down upon me, and
in order to dispatch it, must shut myself
up for a time, and forego the joys of
society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly his old embarrassment came
back upon him, as a small boy&#8217;s enemy&mdash;supposed
to be vanquished&mdash;darts around
the corner, and renews the attack.</p>

<p>He started to go; came back; returned
to the door; again came back; colored
vividly&mdash;looked at me imploringly. And
as I looked at him my anger, my coldness&mdash;all
vanished, and I exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Randolph Chance, why <i>don&#8217;t</i> you say
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some things are awfully hard to say.
I can write&mdash;&mdash; Oh Constance! you might
have mercy on me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, laughing&mdash;I could almost
see the light upon my face&mdash;&#8220;I suppose
you want me to marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get away now!&#8221; he cried, a
second later.</p>

<p>The walls heard a much-smothered
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this little scene, I suppose, is what
makes Randolph always say I proposed to
him. This remark, oft repeated, sometimes
under very trying circumstances, is
his one disagreeableness. But I let it pass
without comment, for I realize it is the
spout to the kettle, and I am thankful that
the steam has so safe and harmless an outlet.
If I were to boil him too hard, he
would probably overflow, and dim the fire;
but I am <i>very cautious</i>, and love still
burns with a clear, bright flame.</p>
